for the first time I can see your eye I be all alone it be clear we will fall from grace we can walk away away from each other . medicate my heart I medicate your heart its just wrong we stay . the cold part have come . we build a perfect place and picture each other . we be white sheet let be write the street could you sit with me ? under the icicle give me your tremble hand I do n't wear kid glove this darkness be complete please do n't say a word oh we will stumble but that be the way we walk . please tell me everything and maybe in the end we ' ll even have lose the fear . we be white sheet let write the street the street , the street , the street , the street , the street , the street , the street ... I try I try to walk alone _____________________________ name let be write the Streets Artist hundred album let be write the Street
