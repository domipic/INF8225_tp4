be this the last meeting place ? will you find me inside the haze ? and will you come ? will you come ? while you be search me , my work be do please tell nobody that I be real they will run over you it will never heal you must forget you must forget Lies this in between certain kind of regret I see them side to be wide on the bird of the flower I will not move but the wind be blow in the field I see them side to be wide on the bird of the flower I will not move but the wind be blow , the wind be blow in the field and in the end you come to late let be talk to my hair I guess that be a fate I will grow fast the high tree in the field you bark up at last I close my eye , recognize your step at the meadow I will make a single noise in my lovely cave I close my eye , recognize your step at the meadow I will make a single noise in my lovely cave _______________________ name song for a Sailor Artist hundred album let be write the Street
