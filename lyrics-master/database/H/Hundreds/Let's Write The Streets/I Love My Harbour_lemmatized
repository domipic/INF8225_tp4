while we walk through empty street you calm our heart beat we see them Rocks and bush fall apart a fetal lose their path we form we lose this desert it will never end our thirst be never fill Let 's move on Purple sky be above our head illuminate aeroplane we run they follow we can try sure we die but we can share some safety some fear Memories and thought be go bright whiten mind do n't talk I be watch window you pull the blindfold down we know it we find it animal have leave their home Trees grow upside down we have our hand we will hide inside a big fish listen to the choir the seaside be wait we can try for sure we die but we can share some safety some fear _______________________ name I Love My Harbour Artist hundred album let be write the Street
