my life leak away , groan by groan . my year be fade in sigh . I be grow weary . I be grow weary . they want to blot me from their memory , forget me like a corpse in a grave , throw me out with the scrap . behind door they plot to ruin me . and I will be honest with you , it be cave in on me . I have be break through wall to get free . neck deep in this sink sand . I will no longer run . but my trust will remain , it be everlasting . your hand hold my day . but my trust will remain , it be everlasting . your hand hold my day . embarrass the wicked . stand them up . leave them shake their head as they drift down to hell , drift down to hell . down to hell . drift to hell . gag the loudmouthed liar who heckle me , your follower . slam the door on those oily , mock face . silence the venom of gossip . I can go it alone . the world be cave in on me . I can go it alone . the world be cave in on me . I can go it alone . the world be cave in on me . the world be cave in on me . ____________ name cave Artist hundredth album when will we surrender
