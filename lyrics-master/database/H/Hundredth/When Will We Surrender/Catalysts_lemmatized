when will we , when will we surrender ? when will we strive for what be good and not for what man have create ? when will we no longer trample the poor , ignore the stomach of the starve ? renew the heart of the hopeless and the strength of the helpless , those who ca n't stand on their own two foot . those who ca n't stand on their own two foot . we gotta change , we gotta change what mean the most to us . when will we look to the hurt before we bandage our own wound ? we say we be martyr , but we will only die for ourselves , we will only die for ourselves . we gotta mend the wound of the desperate . we get the power to change circumstance . we get the power , we get the power to change . let us rise above the storm , rise above the storm . set sail into the sea , set sail into the sea , into the sea . when we pass through water , we will not sink . when we walk through fire , we will not be set ablaze . we will not sink , we will not be set ablaze . instead we sink into your grace , a furnace of your mercy , because you choose the despise and lowly . you choose the despise and lowly . I be despise . I be lowly . we will be the catalyst to reach out to the hurt . we will embrace those who have be abandon . we will be catalyst . we will embrace those who have be abandon . _______________ name catalyst artist hundredth album when will we surrender
