the night , the night be dark just before dawn , just before dawn . so we search for bright day . trudge through field of deceit . this will be the day of amelioration . if we be grant a clear sky . this will be the day of amelioration . if we be grant a clear sky . where we can look up and admire all that you be without a storm in the way , without a storm in the way . there have be so many storm as of late . I know nothing but rain , I know nothing but rain , nothing but rain . nothing but rain . dry up our eye . nothing but rain . dry up our life . nothing but rain . dry up the rain . the storm be inside me . the storm be inside me . the storm be inside me . with so many storm around me , it be no surprise that when I see the sun , see the sun I begin to squint my eye . I ca n't handle it all at once , so I let it in slowly , and bask in my saving grace , my saving grace . ( I need your sun to dry up the rain . ) ______________ name bright Artist hundredth album when will we surrender
