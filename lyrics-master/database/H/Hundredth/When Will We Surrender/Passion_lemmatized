look now with new sight , new sight to see it all . a void with the cruel intention . why be n't we take what be ours ? hour of time and devotion . time be of the essence . let us hold it close . let us hold it close . let us hold it close . let us hold it close . let us hold it close . let us hold it close . it be time to go back to place where we find ourselves , alive and full , know it be in us all along . it be in me , it be in us all along . it be in me , it be in us all along . it be in me . I ca n't scream enough to hold your attention . betray . how many more will fall to the false image you portray . open your heart . open your heart . cause at the end of the day , your ardent love keep me safe . at the end of the day your ardent love keep us safe from fall away , away . _____________ name Passion Artist hundredth album when will we surrender
