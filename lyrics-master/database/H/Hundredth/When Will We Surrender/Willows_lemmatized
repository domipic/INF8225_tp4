why be I waste my time please people around me ? I be sick of wait around for nothing , for nothing . why be I waste my time ? I will not build my legacy on earth , my legacy will not be of this world . I will not build my legacy on earth , my legacy will be too large for this soil . my whole life I have be compare to those around me , expectation on my shoulder and people to please . I will no longer sway with the willow . I will stand strong on my own . when everyone let me down , I will stand strong alone , I will no longer sway with the willow . I will stand strong on my own . when everyone let me down , I will stand strong alone , I will no longer sway with the willow . I will stand strong on my own . when everyone let me down , I will stand strong alone , stand strong alone . stand strong alone . I will stand strong alone . I will stand strong alone . I will stand strong alone . and when the wind hurl , I will not move . I be destine for greatness , I will see it through , I will see this through . we will see this through . _____________ name willow artist hundredth album when will we surrender
