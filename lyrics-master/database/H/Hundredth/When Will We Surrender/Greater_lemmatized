every breath I take recall the wretch I once be , the wretch I remain . fuel by hatred , by greed . the inability to love a world that let me down . my misanthropy eat me alive . my misanthropy eat me alive . my misanthropy eat me alive . my face in the dirt . my head stare down . my head stare down . stare down . a miserable existence , a life fuel by hate . now my face to the world , steadfast . my life once miserable be now immeasurable . my life once miserable be now immeasurable . what can I do with a heart full of hate besides dig place to rest for those I love , besides make bed in the depth for those give up , besides dig place to rest for those I love . my tatter soul need mending and I be do search . no great love than this . no great love . no other love . _____________ name Greater Artist hundredth album when will we surrender
