it be so hard to make an effort , to keep my surroundings in line . when sometimes , I ca n't do it for myself . I confess : I be not the man I proclaim . my foot , my foot be sink into the mire beneath me , the mire , the mire beneath me . I ca n't help but notice the endless battle for air while be sweep by the tide of complacency . my knowledge be accountability and I have to do something , I have to do something . blind by the plank in my eye , I can guide anyone . I have to do something . I have to do something . this lonely vessel be surely sink , I be surely sink . I be surely sink . I be surely sink . take me , if it mean they die to themselves , only to raise up their new life . stop me in my track if it will shake them . stop , stop me . stop me . we be nothing without each other . _____________ name sink Artist hundredth album when will we surrender
