I be nothing without the man who walk before me . I be break by my own pride , my self-hate . bring a plague to my pride . let me know : I be nothing . oh , there be no arm as big as yours . oh , there be no arm as big as yours . let us unite in the fact we be nothing . let us float into the dusk , unite , unite . we be , we be gonna let it shine . let us shine . we be gonna let it shine . let us shine . let me shine . let us shine . we will shine . ___________ name Shine Artist hundredth album when will we surrender
