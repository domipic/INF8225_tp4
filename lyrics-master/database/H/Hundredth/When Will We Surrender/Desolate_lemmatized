what have I gain by give the world my everything ? it have never be such a struggle to regress to what I be yesterday . but today , I seem so far away . I be wait on the world to sing the song I have be sing . I be wait on the world to sink the way I have be sink . the way I have be sink . I have give too much away over these past few year and this be end today . there be pain in my eye like I have never know . I have fall short . do you still see me as beautiful ? do you still see me as beautiful ? carry me home , lighten my stagger . my conscience be weak . I be beg for reparation . I be deficient of hope , deficient of hope . refine me with fire . refine me with fire , oh God . refine me with fire . there be pain in my eye like I have never know . I have fall short . do you still see me as beautiful ? there be pain in my eye like I have never know . I have fall short . do you still see me as beautiful ? I will never find my place on Earth . I will never find , I will never find my place my place on Earth . I will never find my place on Earth . but I refuse to fade away , to fade away . ______________ name desolate Artist hundredth album when will we surrender
