the sun rise and the sun set and hurry back to where it rise . wind to the south , and wind to the north . ever return , return on its course . all stream flow into the sea , yet the sea be never full . the stream return again without an ounce of toil . what have be , will be again , nothing new under the sun . there be nothing new under the sun . lest the adversary misunderstand our hand . lest the adversary misunderstand , misundertand and say our hand have triumph . what have be will be again . nothing new under the sun . what have be , will be again to exalt flesh . what have be will be again . nothing new under the sun . what have be will be do again to exalt flesh . lest the adversary misunderstand our hand . lest the adversary misunderstand , misunderstand and say our hand have triumph . remove our worthless idol . wreck our pride . remove our worthless idol . wreck my pride . remove our worthless idol . wreck my pride . kindle a fire that burn to the realm of death below . devour the earth and its harvest . _________ name Sun Artist hundredth album when will we surrender
