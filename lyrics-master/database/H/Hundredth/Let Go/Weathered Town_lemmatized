look in the rear-view mirror at everything that I be leave behind . I know this be right , I know it be my time . now be my time to escape this weathered town and what this place be all about . I have gotta get out of here , but the memory I will take with me . everywhere I go , to everyone I know . these memory will stay with me . to escape this weathered town and what this place be all about . these memory will stay with me , will stay , will stay with me . and I do n't know , I do n't know if you will ever understand . you can say that it be not worth it . and you can say , you can say it be a waste life . but the memory , I will take with me . these memory , they will stay with me . the memory , I will take with me . these memory , they will stay with me . hold onto the past each day leave me empty , want everything to be the way it be . there be good day to come , I just have to , I have to let go . let go . let go . of the thing that I have do and the one who have move on . I have gotta get out of here , but the memory I will take with me . everywhere I go , to everyone I know . these memory will stay with me . I will escape this weathered town and what this place be all about . the memory , they will stay with me , they will stay , they will stay , they will stay , with me . ____________________ name weather Town Artist hundredth album let go
