the world be in piece , it be fall apart . our life be be shut down . year go by . when will we try not live for ourselves , not live for man . the world , the world I see in front of me be full of thing that should not be , that should not be . when will we change ? when will we see who we be live for ? be you live for yourself or something great ? it be in your hand , be the creator . for the dead and the living we must all bear witness . the life we lead be fill with uncertainty , but no hope mean no reality . get it , hope be a reality . the life we lead be fill with uncertainty . open your eye , see the dark , find the light . I open the black blind , and when I look : the world , the world I see in front of me be full of thing that should not be . when will we see , when will we see , see change ? remember , Hope be a reality . hope be a reality . hope be a reality . remember , hope be a reality . ________________________ name monumental Part II Artist hundredth album let go
