I be gonna live today , live to make a change . there come a time in every life when it 's time to move on . and well hey , that be what it be today . that be what it be today . it be time to make a change . I be never awake , just dream of the day when thing be say and never do . but now this be the life I lead , only to breathe hope into humanity . but I make , I make a promise , I make , I make a promise to myself . I promise I will never go back to think of this place as my wish well . it be the same ol ' take , take , take , I give up on the world and that be all I could give . and I say I will never go back to put myself above the rest . I hold my chin up high , but that be all I could lift . inside of me , inside of me , be a void , be a void , as empty , as empty , as the sky without the sun , empty as the sky without the sun . sky without the sun . I be never awake , just dream of the day when thing be say and never do . but now this be the life I lead , live only to breathe hope into humanity . I be gonna live today . ________________ name Live Today Artist hundredth album let go
