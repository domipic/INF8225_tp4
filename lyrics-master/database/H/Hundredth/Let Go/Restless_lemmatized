I be not okay . I ca n't find stability . I be not okay . I ca n't find stability . thread through my faith with a needle name doubt . put it all together and then tear it apart . throw away the scrap and try to restart . go back to the day when it be sunny and clean . my soul storm until it stop try to shine . it settle for hazy message from a black sky . I still do n't know why , know why . no question I throw up , come back , and I do n't know why . be this what I want to be ? a restless soul wrestle with what I believe . or just a selfish soul blind to problem that tower over me , over me , that tower over me . slow fade out . Sun burn and stay out . cloud close like a mouth . ' round last light and sound . do n't bother , save your breath . could be the last you get . be I jaded to the point where I ca n't see all of the beauty your hand make , the world surround me . I be scare of what have come and what be to be . my heavy heart . the earth will cover me . ______________ name restless Artist hundredth album let go
