I be feed up , I be feed up with the constant flow . get lose in the rhythm . cadence of disdain , melody without satisfaction . but the only thing , the only thing I have be time . risk lay the foundation of my destiny , destiny . risk lay the foundation of my destiny . and if it crumble , at least I know I try . I can stand on that . instead of question why ... instead of question why I never chase down the man I want to be . bury deep inside of me be the door to what I be mean to be . and I , I hold the key . I hold the key . I hold the key . I hold the key . I meet myself in a dream . innocent , adamant , adolescent me . do n't turn your back on me . do n't turn your back on me . this regret wo n't tear through me ( tear through me ) . I will rather fail , I will rather fail than fail to be , myself . this regret wo n't tear through me ( tear through me ) . I will rather fail , I will rather fail than fail to be , myself . ____________________ name I hold the Key Artist hundredth album let go
