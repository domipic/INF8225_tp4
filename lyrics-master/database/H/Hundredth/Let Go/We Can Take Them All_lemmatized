be this the end of everything ? it be all fall down , it be all crash down . everyone be tell me to focus on my dream , but I ca n't lift my head from the suffering below . sometimes I feel like there be no hope for mankind . strap down to tradition , chain to the lie we have be feed . have this go too far ? can we sever the hand of power hang over our head ? we can take them all . let them line up against our generation that say no. we be not stand for this . we be bring you to your knee . turn your back on everything . to expose the lie and gree that you beg us to buy into . I know they be all , I know they be all , I know they be all , I know they be all , Lies . question everything , ' cause nothing be what it seem . and they give fake a face , force-feed the American dream . ship us overseas to be all we can be . we ca n't justify murder with freedom be n't free . I challenge this generation to expand our mind and seek truth for ourselves . I challenge this generation to not buy into the dream set forth by man . I challenge this generation to suffer without luxury and lend our greedy hand . I challenge this generation to not , to not forsake the unseen . __________________________ name we can take Them All Artist hundredth album let go
