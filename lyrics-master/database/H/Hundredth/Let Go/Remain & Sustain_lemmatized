I ca n't put back together all these piece , if everything around me stay the same . why do I compromise the conviction that I have . I be the only one to blame , to blame . I be the one to blame . my life still get lose behind these eye of complacency . tear to shred by monotony , but not today . I need a change . I need a change . let my pride come crash down . my dream they will remain , my purpose it must sustain . my dream they will remain , my purpose it must sustain . sustain . I be put back together all these piece and everything around me be not the same . no longer do I compromise conviction that I have . everything now have change , have change . it be all change . no longer be I lose behind these eye of complacency . I have control of everything , everything . it have to change . it have to change . my pride come crash down . I be only hold myself back , from be all that I can . I be only hold myself back , from be all that I can . I be only hold myself back , from be all that I can . I be only hold myself back , from be all that I can . all that I can . I be hold myself back , hold myself back , from be all I can , all I can . ______________________ name remain & sustain Artist hundredth album let go
