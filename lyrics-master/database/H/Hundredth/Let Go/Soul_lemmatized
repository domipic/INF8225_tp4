if I have a fist for every time I have be trap , I will fight my way out and I will never look back . I be lie down in the dark place . I be lose touch . I ca n't see face . I feel like I be alone , be I alone ? dream never come when I feel this way . I be a victim to everything around me . they present deceit , package with lie , and try to unravel my demise . I have to drive them out of my life . pull the trigger on oppression . I be ready to fight . I be rise up remind myself : dark be the absence of light . if you see the depth of my soul , the sight they could never escape you . my break soul will try and haunt me , to the day that I die . to the day that I die . my break soul . I be Cheatin ' on the sun , Cheatin ' on the sun , Cheatin ' on the sun , Cheatin ' on the sun , Cheatin ' on the sun , with the moon . Cheatin ' on the sun , Cheatin ' on the sun , Cheatin ' on the sun , with the moon . soul . my break soul . __________ name soul Artist hundredth album let go
