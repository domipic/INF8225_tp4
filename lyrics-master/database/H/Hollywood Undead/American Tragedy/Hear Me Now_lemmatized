( now now now now now ) ( now now now now now ) ( now now now now now ) ( now now now now now ) as I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I wear my crown of thorn and pull the knife from my chest I keep search for something that I never seem to find but maybe I wo n't because I leave it all behind now I be stick with this and that will never change always a part of me until the very last day where to go from here , what road to travel on I spend my whole life choosing and it always choose wrong Will I try to have the will to be alive will I try ' cause I have never see the light Blow it to the ground and it be now you see you spend your whole life take the good of me where will you go where be your home how will you end up all alone can you hear me now there be no light there be no sound hard to breathe when you be underground can you hear me now hear me now ( now now now now now ) how low can I keep pretend to be that all the star in the sky could mean something to me heaven will open up if I live on my knee a man of many word but a man of few deed walk these street so absent of hope a pillow of concrete , a man with no home lend him a hand then we will walk him the way leave the virtue of pity but we live with the shame so scare to dream in a world with no sunlight when you wake up you know it be dark than last night quickly we forget , sacrifice go by Born to walk away , be walk my whole life where will you go where be your home how will you end up all alone can you hear me now there be no light there be no sound hard to breathe when you be underground can you hear me now hear me now look into my eye and I see what do I see nothing at all ( nothing at all ) take another look around me what do I see nothing at all ( now now now now now ) ( now now now now now ) where will you go where be your home how will you end up all alone can you hear me now there be no light there be no sound hard to breathe when you be underground can you hear me now hear me now ( now now now now now ) ( hear me now ) ( now now now now now ) can you hear me hear me now _________________ name hear me now Artist Hollywood Undead album American tragedy
