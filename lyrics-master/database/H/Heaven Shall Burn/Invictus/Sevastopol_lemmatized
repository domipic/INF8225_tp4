here we be , wait for the storm . here we be , wait for the storm to come . we know this world will drown in blood . last day of May , this spring be die once again , but we sense this summer may not be ours anymore . within these wall , we be loyal brother , comrade till death . now in the distance we see the fire rage . they will not take this place , will not defile this ground . we be not afraid to die , no one will break this line , this darken world will hear our cry . this darken world will hear our cry . as cloud of dust contaminate the deep blue sky , we be crawl through the debris of our home . here we be , wait for the storm . here we be , this world will drown in blood . now in the distance we see the fire rage . they will not take this place , will not defile this ground . we be not afraid to die , no one will break this line , this darken world will hear our cry . curtain fire , lie in the trench , bury deep as cold ash cover this sway world in grey . inside this fortress , we be faithful sister , comrade till death . as their bomb eclipse this sallow sun and their gun annihilate our sanctuary , our confidence , it will not vanish , not abate , we will not cease resist . now in the distance we see the fire rage . they will not take this place , will not defile this ground . we be not afraid to die , no one will break this line , this darken world will hear our cry ________________ name Sevastopol Artist heaven Shall Burn album Invictus
