the time have come for you why do n't you see the omen open your eye and cast their lie aside your craven king be head nowhere your blind leader , they be head nowhere you be head nowhere I know they tell you to believe their truth but I will never stand this pain I know they say not to worry anymore but I just can look away the truth be plain , this truth be plain close your eye be nothing but surrender how can you ask me if we can save this world for them it die so many year ago get on your knee and greet the omen how often do they prove their ignorance to you how many time do they betray the truth be plain , this truth be plain sell the hard-win value we archived you know that nothing will ever break the beast you know there be million leave for dead but no one broadcast their cry and now you dare to ask me , if we can save this world for them it die so many year ago get on your knee and greet the omen close your eye be nothing but surrender , a rotten act of treason please never ask me , if we can save this world for them it die so many year ago get on your knee and greet the omen ______________ name the omen artist heaven Shall Burn album Invictus
