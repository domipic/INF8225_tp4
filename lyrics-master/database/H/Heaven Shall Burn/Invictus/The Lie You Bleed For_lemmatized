this be the war you call and I be the one who come to judge you . too soon your god will leave , this be the day of your defeat . welcome the newborn slave , forget and betray . just burn it down . Black sky will rise and overshadow your demise . long for the peace of surrender . just stare into the void . welcome the newborn slave , disfranchise and betray . just feed your new find hate , a force nothing will break . just burn it , just burn it down . it be in the air you breathe , an everlasting poison , an order of deceit , it be a lie you bleed for . it be in the word you speak , faint echo of deception . when will you ever see no one will set you free . welcome the newborn slave , forget and betray . long for the peace of surrender . just stare into the void . it be in the air you breathe , an everlasting poison , an order of deceit , it be a lie you bleed for . it be in the word you speak , faint echo of deception . when will you ever see no one will set you free . Und damit du es verstehst , Du folgst den falschen FÃ¼hrern . Der Kampf ist Nie vorbei , Du bist nicht Frei . it be in the air you breathe , an everlasting poison , an order of deceit , it be a lie you bleed for . it be in the word you speak , faint echo of deception . when will you ever see no one will set you free . ___________________________ name the Lie you bleed for Artist heaven Shall Burn album Invictus
