an unforgive chill crawl down my blood stain limb and a thousand frozen body line our way into the night shadow of dead tree appear like ghost in poison cloud heart-wrench cry agonize my soul Hand to hand we fight and man by man we die no sanity be here to find , our god have leave this hell we be wander like shadow through frozen world once my mind be occupy , fill with heroic story , all glorious tale about this war but now I know there be no honor here to find we be march endlessly , relentlessly , towards the end a purgatory we walk through , a common grave for all of us no matter friend or enemy , a forest of the dead heart-wrench cry agonize my soul Hand to hand we fight and man by man we die no sanity be here to find , our god have leave this hell we be wander like shadow through frozen world I should not care about my enemy , tell me what have I become my blacken heart be still beat all of a sudden I be aware compassion be no weakness , compassion be no treason ______________________ name return to Sanity Artist heaven Shall Burn album Invictus
