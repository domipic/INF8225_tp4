forlorn sky their blank eye stare into a forlorn sky disgraceful figure stumble through the mist Sons of their nation , lose generation a tragedy beyond imagination Burnt by the sun , drown in the rain bury alive in this cold , scorch earth no glory leave to find they all have meet their demon they all have stop to cry we be die for no reason forlorn sky we be die for no reason ... no reason ... for no reason the day they march into this abyss Wantoness and confidence affended us and flower blazon our doom we lose our dream we lose our dream these wither heart be wait for the end those who return , will never leave this hell again no glory leave to find they all have meet their demon they all have stop to cry we be die for no reason forlorn sky we be die for no reason a merciless horizon do not promise any hope Father versus father brother against brother a tomb for all humanity no glory leave to find they all have meet their demon they all have stop to cry we be die for no reason forlorn sky we be die for no reason ___________________ name forlorn sky artist heaven Shall Burn album iconoclast ( Part one : the final resistance )
