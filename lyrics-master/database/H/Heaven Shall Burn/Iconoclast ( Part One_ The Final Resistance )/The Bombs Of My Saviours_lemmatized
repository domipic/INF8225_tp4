for year we hide in blackness , we have to sink into oblivion this agony of fear absorb my think this anguish suffocate my soul I see countless act of treason once this heart be fill with force and comfort but now there be nothing anymore the home I know have crumble into dust I know so many of these ruin I watch it burn , my fatherland to blood red sky I pray impatiently I wait , I be wait for the end as I hail the bomb of my saviour as I be crave for these siren wail to leave this cell to cross the night as they crawl into their bunker as they hide away and shake with fear at least I dare to raise my eye and whisper I fill my lung with life again walk empty street and orphan quartiers a shine like daylight in the light ______________________________ name the bomb of my saviour artist heaven Shall Burn album iconoclast ( Part one : the final resistance )
