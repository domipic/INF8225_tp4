a nation reborn reborn into a new world awake from dark era ruin of an insane dream still cast their shadow and demon from the past still walk among us an age that bear no hero no answer to the few who raise their question just like a poison , silence kill the truth a quest for resistance you be search for an easy truth but you betray them , they could not trust you as you march in line and circle as you hold your flag up high they have nowhere to run to your hero , they could not dare to speak to you but the courage you be reclaim , it die a bitter death with them no one here and no one there , no one hear them call __________________________ name Quest for Resistance Artist heaven Shall Burn album iconoclast ( Part one : the final resistance )
