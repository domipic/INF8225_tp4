war skin , comforting hope and ray of orange light . when I spread my arm I leave anything behind . take me away . I be drift , sense be stun and go with the wind . enter the air . . ? ..I will never . take me away , far from here . when i spread my arm I leave everything behind . _______________________ name to follow the Sun Artist Heretoir album Heretoir
