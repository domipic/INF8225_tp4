everybody want a reason for everything it be so much easy with someone or something to blame I have always struggle at the root of the problem have it be absence or my constant lack of defense ? I have never spend a lot on find a remedy I guess I figure that it hurt for a reason , I guess that be why I have always turn to write it down not just in story , but the letter in between , and I guess that be why it haunt the page of everything to self-examine I think the thing be that I shut off from everything from friend and family and my own ambition from have fun ; I just shut off from everything self-defeat ? yeah , probably , but I do n't know that I have total control over it and I be not sure it even matter why sometimes thing happen and you ca n't do anything plus , I be the only one who deal with it anyway so if everyone could do me a favor and just put their finger down , I will - and keep your mouth sorry , I know I seem angry . I be not , I ... ; I promise , I just know I do this to me and I will deal with it accordingly , and I do n't need opinion from those never a part of it do n't need them point out my problem , they be mine do n't need reminder ; I know good than anyone and yeah I know , I should be find another way I know that I should be out seek a substitute but just forget never really make sense to me so I have n't be do I feel embarrassed about it ? I think you know the answer to that I think you will probably feel a little bit embarrass for me , would n't you ? I know I should have move on age ago Been happy already , but it have never be that easy for me or maybe it be me that make it so hard I know I have only ever try a handful of time to sever this thing torture me it never get me anywhere with anyone ; no friendship or hobby , no lover 's bed work but look back I maybe never try hard enough and it be my fault maybe I never try at all ______________ name a Letter Artist La Dispute album Wildlife
