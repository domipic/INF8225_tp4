like a shadow on a shadow a phantom in a film strip faint glimmer of the past trap in mother 's old slide sit still in the apartment while sift through some picture of the child that he once be and the sense of hope they frame " it be a shame " and I fear that fate while the hum from the street keep me awake he say , " I let life get twist get wear out , tear up and late with the rent and now nothing make sense except the bench and that piano a feeling near order when I be press down the chord " and he play and it swell and break but what will it take to make my life sound like that and bring a fever a dream of sweat and ecstasy a kiss on every hammer hit that follow as the key fall down and bring an order first then chaos , then a calm that paint every shift in mural on the wall and it press to your neck it clutch to your hip softly sing to you of firework and God and art and sex and it be strange that it feel so right when nothing else do but all the while he be playing there be a hum come up and through the window from outside and even he have to admit a certain melody in it but then , why ca n't he harmonize ? it be like the city have get its own song but he ca n't play along he see the note as they fly by but always play them wrong and in the bathroom , it get blurry get warm and distort like light push through the orange of the pillbox he pour in his palm it fall to the floor he smile as it hit sound a little like an instrument like a voice in the choir that hum and that drumbeat of life as an art-form and fire through the street that keep move us in silence to phantom baton sweep keep tap to the tempo of our foot and all the one who seem to fit the good into the chorus never notice there be a song and the one who seem to hear it end up tortured by the chord when they fail to find a way to sing along and when you sing the wrong thing it all start collapse start to ring out and feedback start lapse and crash on note that do n't clash but that never quite feel like they match and I never quite feel like mine match there be a melody in everything I be try to find a harmony but nothing seem to work nothing seem to fit there be a melody in everything I be try to find a harmony but nothing seem to work nothing seem to fit there be a melody in everything I be try to find a harmony but nothing seem to work nothing fit ______________________ name Harder harmony Artist La Dispute album Wildlife
