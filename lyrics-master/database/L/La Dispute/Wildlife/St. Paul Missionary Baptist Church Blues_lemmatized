stained-glass and the choir sing out that strong and ceaseless chorus here so sweet the voice , sweep like leaf into the street , on Easter a celebration , carry on for God and hope and refuge to keep each other , life give shelter from the storm ( and keep warm ) the congregation gather outside in the parking lot each service do , they keep the old hymn Rolling on and on , and I see the scene in color each day drive out to Eastown that old abandoned church and have I go the same sad way ? have I go the same sad way ? through the sixty flourish and the seventy do flux the eighty fluctuate each year unclear when the money would dry up and when the ninety violent crime and rise unemployment rate come by that parking lot grow dim and thin of sinner and saint until the voice unceasing , slowly fade to black until the weed storm the concrete from unattended crack it have to know , have to feel that glory never come back like I could feel it when the passion leave the last of what I have it have to know like I know and I ca n't find it back might not ever ten year now , stand vacant ten year on empty , maybe more once hold the faith of hundred soon one more cell phone store for year , they gather here inside the building , sound and true to sing their praise to a god that give them hope , to carry on to carry through so I have be think about that sometimes go slow when I drive by how a home of stone and a house so holy grow so empty over time what give those people purpose past death approach constantly now leave to crumble slowly now leave to wither with the weed now leave to ice and vandal the advent candle long since go the old foundation shift hard the concrete overgrow , but that stained-glass window sit untouched amongst the brickwork wear a symbol of the beauty only perfect at that moment we be bear and just the other day I swear I see a man there Pulling weed out of the concrete sweep up and patch crack I see him lift a rag to Wash the year of filth from off those window make me wonder if there be anyone like that for you and me and anybody else who break and lose hope ______________________________________________ name St. Paul missionary Baptist Church Blues Artist La Dispute album Wildlife
