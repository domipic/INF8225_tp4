so here go ... ; one last letter now one last attempt to make sense who have I be write to ? I be not sure any more what have I be try to accomplish ? it be a mystery , I guess self-made secrecy thing get cloudy and now all these story and the struggle as an undercurrent both get blurry by the minute both get blurry so which voice be this then that I be write in ? be it my own or his ? have there ever be a difference between them at all ? I do n't know I do n't know one last desperate plea one last verse to sing one last laugh track to accompany the comedy have I be lose it completely lose sanity ? or have it be fabricate fashion by the bad of me ? I know I knock the table over because I watch the jar break and I have be try to repair it every single stupid day but wo n't the crack still show no matter how well it be assemble ? can I ever just decide to let it die and let you go ? all my motive and every single narrative below reflect that moment when it break and will I never let it go no matter what ? now I be throw all the shard away discard every fragment and fumble uncertain towards a curtain call that no one want to happen that no one be go to clap for at all but that still have to be __________________ name a Broken jar Artist La Dispute album Wildlife
