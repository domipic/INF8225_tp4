third time write you a letter get dark I be get bad and bad I have a reason for the write but try to exorcise my demon do n't work to try to rid me of the worry and to purge you out of wonder for the future and the hurt I write a poem I be increasingly aware I have be paint thing in gray I be increasingly alarm by the pain I be increasingly alive to every cloud up in the sky I be increasingly afraid it be gonna rain see , lately I have hate me , for over-playing pain for always point finger out at everyone , but who in fact be guilty and for pick at my scab like they could never break but they can and they will and I will spill like a leak in the basement a drunk in the night choir just slur all those word to make deadbeat that sweet old refrain Self-inflicting my pain and therein lie the real shame I hear when they be Picking through the rubble find limb , they sing hymn but now what of what I see ? the worry , the wonder the shortness of day the replacement for purpose the thing sweep away by the worry , the wonder my slightness of frame the replacement for feel the casual lay and the bad of the wildlife Wear clothes and can pray and the worry , the wonder for three meal a day only death unimpeded not slow it 's pace bring that petty , old worry and wonder away ____________ name a poem Artist La Dispute album Wildlife
