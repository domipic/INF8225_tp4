after sundown , before sleep I be the bad of me I be a mess of these old theme and the murmur of half-dreams whisper seductively and stage scene , it 's fear fiction , these vision catch somewhere between delusion and prophesy what I have n't do what I have want to and what I fear you have become reality here bright light in the young night keep to the beat a classic party scene crowded and interesting no love , no life , no history just touch , just chemistry , just a roar undercurrent simple and sensory young body , warm skin Perfect symmetry and it be a moment harmless ; it be energy it be like medicine it be self-discovery , see all the secret I keep why be they secret ? it be only temporary that fleeting feeling of warmth just a flash before the line get blurry between a longing for more than what the body want now and what the body want now more than anything ? be it integrity that keep my hand to myself or just the thought of get too far ahead of you ? be it that I get too tired of the consequence ? or be I just scare ? I only know I never want to get leave behind no pause , not a second guess first a swaying , then a stumble , then a swagger they be just movement towards feel it do n't matter , neither hesitate to carry on a kind of energy , sweat and block out everything to find every aperture and compel the animal part Fan flame , taste fruit , taste bitter fruit just try to learn how all the wire in the body work just try to feel it out , it be like medicine find the healing in whatever bed they end up in I want to feel it out I want to know how it work I want to know if it be worth it to worry about the ghost I fear would haunt the memory about the damage that I be sure the fear have do to me now I want to know what it be in me that wo n't follow through those night the instinct take a hold of me and push too maybe it be only that I have never get over you or be I still scare ? I see the church step a vision be there fiction in this one too ? it be true I have make a tale of it here still it be a little unclear who have be haunt who and time can be such a funny thing always move to the future glorify the past and amplify the pain in frame of glass so be our touch half as sacred as I have make it seem or just another fabrication of a half-dream ? just those chemical , the adolescent love just us try to grasp onto mean onto a purpose onto a sense that something spiritual release when the feeling hit and when the feeling hit and in that moment , spark and harp play out a sweeping melody through fog and fantasy and in that moment there be an honesty instinctive and pure but it depart like it come Rapid and bear no more than fleeting ecstasy of natural harmony they fear the note be play and try to sing along do n't be ashamed , be free to the feeling do n't be ashamed , keep feeling but find it , a body that make sense I have feel it _____________________________________ name the most beautiful Bitter Fruit Artist La Dispute album Wildlife
