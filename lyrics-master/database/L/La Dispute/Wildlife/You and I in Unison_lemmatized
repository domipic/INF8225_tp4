what will I find ? some sacred thing to help me handle the tragedy ? or do I once do I have it and lose it ? no one should ever have to walk through the fire alone no one should ever have to brave that storm , no everybody need someone or something and when I sing do n't I sing your name out right at the same time that I sing my own ? some day , I swear I can feel you split the light through the window frame the shape it make be always warm , always bright than the rest of what come through some day , I swear I can hear you sing to me , or whisper my name in the slight way it be like the warm light now lay across my bedroom floor be somehow actually you and not just sunlight I have the memory , climb down the balcony I put a flower on the back of its dress , it be probably well to forget it it be probably well to let go I paint it the shade of where the skin and the lip meet only a moment after break the kiss , and I blur out everything else that be how I choose to remember it some night be a lot like the day , I lie awake too late I watch the shadow cast and trace your shape those silver sliver on the wall , then on the bedsheet I hear your song in the tree I finally fall into rest often later when I be sleep you show up in my dream just do simple thing , like buy grocery , and when I wake up , I could swear you must have just leave me like you get up to get breakfast or maybe just to get dress but the truth be you be never there , you wo n't ever be sometimes I think I be not either so what do I do when every day still seem to start and end with you ? and you wo n't ever know you wo n't ever see how much your ghost since then have be define me I leave the memory up atop the balcony I tear this flower from the back of the dress it be well this time , I bet to just forget and let go paint it the shade of where the lip bleed and blur it out I blur out everything else just blur out everything else and let go , and let go , and let go everybody have to let go someday everybody have to let go I wonder when I will , I wonder but if I still hear you sing in every city I be in after I blur it all out , our every memory , if you never fade with the day , your shape still haunt me then should I not just sing along ? should I not just sing along ? I will sing sweetly Hope that the note change but I do not need it to happen I be not resign to it and if they never do I will sing your name in every line just like I do throughout this just like I have always do in every gun , the empty church and every tortured son in all those give up in all those give in until I die I will sing our name in unison until I die I will sing our name in unison until I die , until I _________________________ name you and I in unison Artist La Dispute album Wildlife
