... for everything night fall on me write this and I run out of paper so I cross the name out at the top of the page not sure why I be even write this but I guess it feel right it sort of feel like I have to like an exorcism I guess that make me sound crazy but that be alright lately I feel like I might be not that I have hear any voice or anything just like that everyday kind where you forget thing you should n't and you think too much about death maybe you know what I be talk about ? or maybe you would have know ? or have know ? be it once know ? I do n't know what tense to use I know I never use to feel like this I use to never think of death or hear voice I use to feel like everything be perfectly in order a normal life , but I guess then come a departure that I know you understand or would have understand I guess thing change after that and I be mostly scare now but it be there in the story or whatever they be you can see it anybody could , if they could look I write some note in the margin explain it the rest be in between line or in the fine print First , the feeling of abandonment then try to cope then death and hope and the thing itself wait for me it be all there in the page ahead of here it be there , wait for you or for me ; I be not sure the whole story for everything for everything _________________ name a departure Artist La Dispute album Wildlife
