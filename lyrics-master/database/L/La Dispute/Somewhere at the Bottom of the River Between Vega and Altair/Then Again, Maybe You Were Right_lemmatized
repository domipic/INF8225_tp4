I speak too soon , it seem for you make a home in my dream while I sleep you keep run yourself through my head like , I wo n't be dead yet , I say , " you do n't understand we have no control , they steal it love have be so unfair to me " " but see , boy , that be my point you must move on " then feel her ghost move in me I hear her voice call out my name but this time it fade out , away I will bury it today , today so I breathe her name out into a cold , cold room watch her ghost ascend the wall , and then dissolve this time I choose to let it go this time I choose to let her go I will not let my fear become the only world I have ever know I know my heart , come kiss my mouth and set me free , I have wound to mend and we will be more than friend , my dear I fear I have change my mind again but , boy , you be too late but , boy , you be too late my love , you be too late oh , God , it be too late too late too late ______________________________________ name then again , maybe you be Right Artist La Dispute album somewhere at the Bottom of the River between Vega and Altair
