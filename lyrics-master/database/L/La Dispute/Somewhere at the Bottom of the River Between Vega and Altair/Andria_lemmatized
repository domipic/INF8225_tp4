you still cross my mind from time to time and I mostly smile still so set on find out where we go wrong and why so I retrace our every step with an unsure pen try to figure out what my head think , but my head just ai n't what it use to be and then again , what be the point anyway ? I remember you ascend all the stair up to the balcony to see if you could see me , hide quietly away I remember the skin of your finger the spot three quarter up I will always touch when I be out of thing to say you hold my hand , but you be too afraid to speak you be too afraid to speak and I could never understand I remember when you lean in quick to kiss me , and I swear not a single force on earth could stop the tremble of my hand and I remember how you smile through the smoke in a crowded little coffee house and laugh at all my joke and I remember the way that you dress how we waste all the good of us in alcohol and sweat and I remember when I know that you will be leave how I barely keep up breathe and I bet , if I have to do it all again I will feel the same pain and I remember panic circle in the terminal in tear how I weep to god in fit I have hate airport ever since it must be true what people say that only time can heal the pain and every single day I feel it fade away , but I still remember how the distance trick us and lead us helpless by the wrist into a pit to be devour I still remember how we hold so strong to this though we have never really settle on a way out I still remember the silence and how we will always find a way to turn and run to our mistake I still remember how it all come back together just to fall apart again my dear , I hear your voice in mine I have be alone here I have be alone here I have be afraid , my dear I have be afraid , my dear I have be at home here I have be at home here you have be away for year you have be away for year I have be alone I have be alone I have be alone I have be alone I breathe your name into the air I etch your name into me I feel my anger swell I swim into its sea I hold your name inside my heart but it get bury in my fear it tear the wiring of my brain I do my good to keep it clear so , dear , no matter how we part I hold you sweetly in my head and if I do not miss a part of you a part of me be dead if I ca n't love you as a lover I will love you as a friend and I will lay a bed before you keep you safe until the end ____________ name Andria Artist La Dispute album somewhere at the Bottom of the River between Vega and Altair
