now speak of anger forget all the fear you have keep about love and sex and death and faith erase , or swing sweet from around her neck and between her breast let every lonely body finally break its fear of flesh and say , " how strange it must have be back when we shake at the sight of sweat " and let our worry wander out like water stream from a spring and sing of all the thing our head have fail to ruin there be so much they have fail to ruin yet bright as lightning Loud as thunder we will move all the hurt aside to let love sustain our passion and move up and onward we be not our loss we be only the extent to which we love so build a home for your family and build a castle for your friend now set their bed with sheet and blanket keep them safe until the end I have feel the damage and burn from the fallout my love fail but theirs prevail my friend , I be only flesh and bone but I wo n't let you die alone so leave our heart at the foot of the mountain let our burden be lock in the stone if you will help me roll it upward I wo n't let you die alone I see a beauty spring upward from the earth and from out our heart for all the bad that seem to plague us I swear to you there be good no , oh , I wo n't let you die alone my love , I will not let you die alone they say that death be not a problem it be a promise I can only say for sure that when it make your bed I will kiss your head goodnight so speak of all the love we lose and what it cost us leave us beg our breath to stop but we keep on and we be strong and we , and we stay bright as lightning we sing loud as thunder we move ever forward we be not our failure we be love _________________________ name the Castle Builders Artist La Dispute album somewhere at the Bottom of the River between Vega and Altair
