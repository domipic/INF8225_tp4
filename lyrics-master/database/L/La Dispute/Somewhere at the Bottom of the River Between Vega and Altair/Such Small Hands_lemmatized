I think I see you in my sleep , darling I think I see you in my dream , you be stitch up the seam on every break promise that your body could n't keep I think I see you in my sleep I think I see you in my sleep , darling I think I see you in my dream , you be stitch up the seam on every break promise that your body could n't keep I think I see you in my sleep I think I hear the door open , oh no think I hear the door open but I only hear it close I think I hear a plane crash but now I think it be your passion snap I think you see me confront my fear , it Went up with the bottle and go down with the beer and I think you ought to stay away from here there be ghost in the wall and they crawl in your head through your ear I think I see you in my sleep , lover I think I see you in my dream , you be stitch up the seam on every mangle promise that your body could n't keep I think I see you in my sleep ______________________ name such Small Hands Artist La Dispute album somewhere at the Bottom of the River between Vega and Altair
