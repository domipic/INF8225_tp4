she force a smile , say , " Boy , come kiss my mouth . you know that hope you be hold to ? it look an awful lot like fear . now , you be so quick to fall on failure , and so quick to raise your voice , like , ' if I ca n't find a mistake to blame , we do n't have a choice . ' oh , but you have an option . I be your chance to feel complete , but when I lean in close to you , you kiss your fear instead of me . you have my hand in your hand , you have my lip in your tooth , you have my heart on your sleeve , you have a chance to breathe . but , boy , you would n't let your fear recede so I move on . and it be too late to change your mind now , you get scared , boy , and I get go . now you fail , and there be no way to turn back time . you have your chance , boy , I try . " " you try ? " I look her in the eye and smile , " my girl , you must understand that fear be not some product that I make . it creep unwelcome in my head the day they have her tear away . it change me . now at the end of every day I lie awake at night and wait to feel the wire of my brain get cut and quietly rearrange , and hear my beaten heart exclaim , ' still , I refuse to let her go . ' so we escape to our mistake for they wait patiently for us . oh , how they always wait for me . if my fear have keep me here , only my fear can set me free . and I be sorry , dear , but do n't you dare speak another word . how could I risk hold your heart in me while still in love with her ? you be wrong .
