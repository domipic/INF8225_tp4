I feel your sickness Brush against my arm as I walk by you hear your voice but could n't tell that it be you and slowly watch your sickness slip away into a place that I have once fear , but I be not afraid this time so I give chase and find it , finally slowly feed from your head and from my friend , and from my family so I grab it by the neck " for every lover you have ruin ... ; " I dig my nail into its flesh " ... ; and every life that you have take " slam its head against the brick its blood pour out onto the pavement I stir it in with dirt and spit " I will take a part of you " I make mortar from the mix Tore every organ from its body break its bone and fashion brick I lay the mortar in between I make a throne for hope to sit " too long you have tear us into piece firmly hold onto our wrist today I bury you in me " I swallow every inch of it I will I will hold you as you have hold me you have hold me in your heart we will be we will be set free from we will be set free from fear , we will be set free Oh we have feel our failure we have watch our passion leave , but we be still breathe oh but we be still beat on I will I will hold you as you have hold me you have hold me in your heart ( and I will hold you in my heart ) but I still see him Dead in the parking lot at the gas station just down the street and I still hear my friend say " you know , you would n't believe the thing I see when I be station overseas " but he somehow keep smile in spite all of that while I keep find way to push the good out for the bad oh how selfish of myself to always say that it be more than I could take like it be pain I could n't shake like it could break me with its finger throw my body in the lake and I would slowly sink away but the truth be , it be sorrow that I make and would n't face see , I keep fall for the future after trip on the past and I be always tear suture out to make the anguish last like it define me or remind me I have find comfort in my suffering and uncertainty in happiness and death because what be next be such a mystery to me and I be terrify of all the thing I feel but can see friend and family put your hand into my hand and lay your head into my chest you be all that I have leave here we be all that we have leave we be the lover we be the last of our kind so link your arm and keep your chin up and I swear that we will be fine we be the lover we be the last of our kind though we be not sure who we be we keep our head up though we be not sure where we be from we keep our heart up though we be not sure when we will leave we keep our head up though we be not sure where we will go we keep our hope up though we be not sure who we be we keep our head up though we be not sure where we be from we keep our heart up though we be not sure when we will leave we keep our head up though we be not sure where we will go we keep our hope up keep your head up we be fine just keep your head up I swear we will be alright keep your head up my friend , my friend keep your head up I swear I swear we will never die , I swear we will get home safe and sound , I swear I swear we will never die , I swear we will live on underground , I swear I will give your heart a place to rest when everything you have have turn and leave I will weave your name into my ribcage Lock your heart inside my chest regain the passion I once carry do away with all the rest I tear the sickness from your body smash its head against the brick I make a castle from its bone that you may always dwell in it so sing for every bury moment that you have think would never end and sing your fear about the future and a dirge for fade friend for all the love that you have hold to why it somehow fail to keep and sing each minute you have be frighten every hour that you have lose sleep and sing for all your friend and family Sing for those who do n't survive but sing not for their final outcome Sing a song of how they try we live amidst a violent storm leave us unsatisfied at well so fill your heart with what be important and be do with all the rest we be what be leave of what we once be we be fall far behind there be so much stack up against us and we be run out of time we be but hopeful child and we be the last of our kind but if we let our heart move outward I know we will never we be but friend and family we be the last of our kind so hold my hand , I will lift your head up and I promise we will be fine we be but hopeful lover and we be run out of time there be so much stack up against us and we be fall far behind we be but hopeful lover we be the last of our kind but if we let our heart move outward I know we will never we be but lover we be the last of our kind and if we let our heart move outward I know we will never we be but lover we be the last of our kind and if we let our heart move outward we will never die _____________________________ name the last lost continent Artist La Dispute album somewhere at the Bottom of the River between Vega and Altair
