I know that someday you will be sleep , darling likely dream off the pain I hope you will hear me in the streetlight hum softly breathe out your name I know that even with the seam stitch tightly , darling scar will remain I say we scrape them from each other , darling and let them wash off in the rain and when they run into the river oh no , let the water not complain I swear that even with the distance slowly Wearing at your name your hand still catch the light the right way and our heart still beat the same and our heart still beat the same _______________________________ name nobody , not even the Rain Artist La Dispute album somewhere at the Bottom of the River between Vega and Altair
