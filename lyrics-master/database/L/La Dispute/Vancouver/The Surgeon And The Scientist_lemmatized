do n't call this an art project this be science , this be progress and do n't pretend these be heartfelt word we be child dress as surgeon but disturb by the sight of our scar and now we carry scalpel to trace the scar resting somewhere on the line between my house your heart and into your home where you lie sleep like a ceiling fan in winter gently turn as the wind reach its finger through the window just to hold you , like I hold you press like a rose between my finger or like stone I keep in pocket mean to weigh me underwater mean to keep me underwater I mean to keep me underwater these scar will fade away but never disappear , my dear we will raise our fist like lightning rod to god and if he strike us down , then he strike us down but first , let him hear us speak we be like the legacy of thunderstorm we watch and swear in doorway that we would never be the same again I can feel you healing and I hate it like a harpist without hand you only bang the string you use to love to touch so much to hear the dissonance drain violently into the air and then dissolve like all the song I sing but never once could make you smile my god , I would kill to make you smile my god , I would kill to make you smile oh , my god , I would kill to make you smile my god , I would kill to make you smile my god , I would kill to make you smile my god , I would kill to make you smile , smile , smile and reach out to my hand , soft and frail to make good on the love that you swear still exist , and still thrive though we have bury our body in blood and old lie , like , " I be fine " and " you look so much good than him " but do n't trust the surgeon with your heart she be drunk and sip from poison cup and do n't you trust the scientist he say " Life be like a wineglass " as he spill his drink , like secret all across your dress and say " my dear , I must confess I never think you ever know what love be like for real I never think you need me " ___________________________________ name the Surgeon and the scientist Artist La Dispute album Vancouver
