pick up the phone bless be the thief , disguise in skin and blessed be the finger that gesture him in paint the receiver , to the side of the fake lie at the bottom of the staircase broken elbow and you be come through the window and whoever call night a blanket have never the feel the cold and whoever call the night a blanket so use your finger , darling and tear away at the restraint they call the body it be the temporary thing that rip us apart for the body be but a piece of art , for you to tear to piece and to the night under the blanket , under the weight of the world this be history to thievery it be the crying and the scream for the lie and the lack thereof and I can feel the blood as it saturate your face this be history to thievery these be only game we play this be history to thievery these be only game we play Hang up the phone ___________________________________ name a Word of welcome and Warning Artist La Dispute album Vancouver
