crow , wipe the blood off the end of your claw say the vulture , let gather like storm for the war , for the war crow , as the night turn its skin into coal dark as corpse but clutter with gold they will label you thief , wolf , and whore , but you be nothing less than angel you be nothing less than angel you be nothing less than angel you be nothing less than angel Cast down and cover in black Ai n't this the bloody mess in the world ? say the virgin , a torn little girl Boy , you go and make a sweet wreck of my soul and I have already forgive you and blood be run down her dress in stream , into her hand where she be stitch on the flesh he have leave in section on the carpet near a bed that never sleep while you be sleep in her clothes that he have lay with on the floor with all his finger cross , in hope that that distance would n't grow but how it grow , and how it hurt and how it hallow every memory he have never feel be threaten by a thing the world could conjure up to kill them Oh , but he let it kill them what a bunch of fool we lover be and now she be smile with herself put back together just a shadow of the past before the war , all sew together like a city sick from Storms and sick of wait for a God to call the flood out of her home what a bunch of fool we lover be , we lover be when tempt by the taste of flesh " my boy , you be nothing more than a thief and a whore in a suit of the fine of armor " laugh the vulture , laugh the vulture " pathetic little child , I be embarrassed for you " _________________ name Future Wars Artist La Dispute album Vancouver
