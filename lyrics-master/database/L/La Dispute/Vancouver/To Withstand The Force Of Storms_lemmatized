oh , you have a pretty mouth leave your lip to linger on my skin and kiss me one last time I will roll off your tongue like a whisper in the winter sleeping in the suture of the City 's skin make yourself remember me in cold and concrete oh , when will you realize oh , the city make you real ? when will you realize your demon make you real ? oh , you have a pretty mouth leave your lip to linger on my skin and kiss me one last time I will roll off your tongue like a whisper in the winter sleeping in the suture of the City 's skin make yourself remember me in cold and concrete it be the way my hand feel lie still beneath your dress it be the way my hand feel oh , I be transparent oh , I be a greenhouse fill with ghost I be transparent , oh oh dear god Oh my god whisper secret speak in a hush voice the first thing that you learn be that you never let them hear you in a soundproof room in a windowless world keep your voice down or dull your word then put on your bedroom face for him all purse lip and half-closed eye with pink-stained skin scream for sleep hand on down dress scream for dead leg come alive for dead leg come alive for dead leg come alive Oh dear god there be no excuse for me Oh dear god what have I do ? I still love you but I do n't love myself ______________________________________ name to withstand the Force of Storms Artist La Dispute album Vancouver
