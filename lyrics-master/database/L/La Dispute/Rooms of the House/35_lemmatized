driver out on the bridge slow down as they go through a lane shift Wires snap concrete give metal twisting and everything tumble at the end of the work day Stuck in traffic , do n't feel when the road sway underneath concrete give metal twisting and everything tumble to their partner and kid do n't suspect anything ' til the bridge split Wires snap concrete give metal twisting and everything tumble down where I sit , I see brake light flash and I picture them , all the people their face in free fall , the water beneath I push my palm against the table hard to see if it hurt be it glass , would I have shatter it ? could I battle every impulse to panic and then win Swim out through the metal twist upward like a sculpture or some terrible beast ? people trap in their car put both foot on the glass and then kick hard Water pour in seatbelt twist River flow and everything go down people under the water line worker sift through the wreckage of it , find seatbelt stick Water fill up river flow and everything go downstream on the dining room wall , I watch it play in the reflection of the television the reversal in the mirror hang , I could see it all how the dust cloud gather color as they billow out shade change shift in the night from the light atop an ambulance like a firework 's flash , then that otherworldly glow in the smoke throw in the aftermath blow almost freeze for a moment there I could see it all every dust cloud shatter glass Billow out on the TV Wires snap and the concrete give metal twist up and onward I can see it all every dust cloud shatter glass Billow out on the TV Wires snap and the concrete give in metal twist up and onward , I watch and I can see it all all the wreckage all the car pile in the river and the rail yard the metal twist Wires snap concrete block split and dangle from tie rod and metal twist up Wires sway when a breeze blow in the distant siren glow I can see it all where they look for survivor searchlight float change the color of smoke cloud and shadow still fall people under the water people trap in their car Kick and try to get out people still with their seat belt on pet they have in the back and car seat and I watch it on TV lie down here on the floor in the dining room , reverse in the mirror where I know I be not dream now but I know I have be sleep I just do n't know since when I only know that it be light outside I only know that the rent be still late when do they find out the concrete give ? when do they learn that the wire snap ? ________ name @card@ Artist La Dispute album room of the House
