morning after snowstorm , stand in the silence almost feel reborn , all alone on the street it be a certain sort of stillness when the quiet surround you the only sound , your shovel on concrete I remember those pile from the snow plow always seem much big back when I be kid push all of the snow to the end of the driveway I be the only person up in the neighborhood morning after snowstorm I turn the ignition and I start my car morning after snowstorm I scrape off my windshield with the edge of a credit card I remember that drive into work still can hear the voice come over the radio listen to our expert give the good tip for the next time you entertain dinner guest I think of the day in a tie in the kitchen , I sit and I watch you put make-up on thought of the day in the basement when I play house I feel ashamed that I have stay in my head in the same place for so long because I be afraid to change but that be not an excuse to stay morning after snowstorm I climb up on the snowbank and I stare at the neighborhood morning after snowstorm I think I finally understand what they mean when they say there be a calm after the storm Saw my grandpa at his workbench building grandma 's bookshelf watch a woman walk her trash out to the street Father alone on the highway I hear the salt truck and neighbor off to work Saw my mother Saw how history loop around all of these moment and then I see you in a dress there with your eye open wide to put make-up on thought of the day in the basement that I play house and I feel ashamed I have ignore all the hand that extend before and around me because I be afraid to change but that be not an excuse to stay it be not an excuse ________________________________ name extraordinary dinner Party Artist La Dispute album room of the House
