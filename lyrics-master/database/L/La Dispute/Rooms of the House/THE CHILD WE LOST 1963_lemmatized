there be shadow in the bedroom where the light get throw by the lamp on the night stand on your mother 's side , after midnight , still you can see it all , you can see it all and the closet in the corner on the far back shelf with the keepsake , she hide that box there , full of letter of regret by the picture of the kid you get faint recollection of your Mother 's sigh , countryside drive and the landscape see from the window of the back seat with some flower in a basket that afternoon after school you and your old sister find your parent in the kitchen at the table Father lift off the lid of the box and a hush fall over everything like a funeral prayer a reverence , ancestral , heavy in the air though you do n't understand what it mean that they never say her name aloud around you even sit at the table with her thing they have keep you recall faintly card , tiny clothes and the smell of the paint in the upstairs bedroom until then you do n't know that be what the box have hold your parent tiptoe slowly around always speak in code no , they never say her name aloud around you only tell you it be perfect where your sister go and you do n't understand why it hurt them so much then that she will come and leave so soon could only guess inside your head at what a " stillbirth " mean only know that mother weep you watch while father hold her say " some thing come , but ca n't stay here " you see a brightness , like a light through your eye close tight then she tumble away from here , some place to remain in the night time shadow she make to be an absence in mom a sadness hang over her like some Pentecostal flame drift on and off she be " sister " only whisper sometimes " Her " or " the child we lose " you be vision a vagueness a fade image you be vision you be a flame light that burn out twice as brightly as the rest of us do when you leave , you be light then you tumble away there be shadow that fall still here at a certain angle in the bedroom on the night stand by your mother 's side from the light leave on there there be the box in the closet all the thing keep and the landscape where she leave flower on the grave Marble where they etch that name and mother cry the whole way home but she never say it once out loud on the way back home from where you think they mean when they say where sister go after grandpa get hospice sick and he could n't fall sleep they wheel his stretcher bed beside her at night and I see the light on the day that he die by their bed in grandma 's eye while us grandkid say our goodbye she say , " do n't cry " somewhere he hold her and say a name I do n't recognize and the light with all the shadow combine ... ; ____________________________ name the child we lose @card@ Artist La Dispute album room of the House
