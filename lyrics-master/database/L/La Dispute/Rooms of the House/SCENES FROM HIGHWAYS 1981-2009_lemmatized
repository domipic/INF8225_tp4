I let the car drift some Eye your uncomfortable pose in profile the posture of long drive that endless cycling of your numb and near sleep part and you lean much hard than you need when the road curve swerve through traffic and the crack in the ground every gesture you require of a drive like this night when you fight now you just head out of town I let the wheel go over center line inside a place without time a loop through history Eye you in periphery now prone in the passenger seat it be a mystery the way you can sleep I want to leave here for where nobody go I want to breathe in the air of all those sprawling ancient space on earth you say we be so scare of alone and I know what you mean you want to go where it glow all those place where your watch do n't work you be ride those night on the highway , always hide out inside a songwriter 's dream there like a scene from a song " bear to run " or maybe " run on empty " one where they would leave certain night when you will fight you could n't stick around so you will head out of town just hit the highway and drive certain night when you have think it be fine but it shake you when the baby would cry why do you always turn around in the end ? to hear the shatter of glass on the door again ? so loud the baby could n't sleep any more ? what do n't you find that you be look for ? your mother call a hardware set you up an interview an answer to an ad the boss ' daughter still remember dinner where her father say he would n't stick his neck out for trouble again but they do then and those day you will wake up and just decide you would n't show he will show up at your door night you will skip town he will follow you out Pretty soon you start fall for their daughter and she fall for you Drive , roll every window down let the desert enter , heavy and primitive in drift ' til rumble strip sound time move so slow but I know that you mean what you say you want to go where it be freeze all those place where the highway do n't reach you want to go where it glow somewhere that time be irrelevant you want to go where it glow somewhere the space be infinite you want to go where it glow somewhere you do n't feel the hour pass by you identify the flower on the road I roll the window down and shut off the radio do you ever think you will end up here ? all those late night you be drive alone ? you be ride to hide or you be look for a brand new life do you ever think you will find one back home ? do you even think you will get out alive ? could you imagine then , the love you now know ? I think history be a system of road and there be nowhere it do n't go I pull over to the side and feel no time off the highway with the landscape aglow still not sure what we be try to find I only know we go home ____________________________________ name scene from highway @card@ artist La Dispute album room of the House
