I be on the ice and I be underwater I be get pull out I be in my wet clothes stumble on the walk back someone stoke the fire at camp I be by the flame try to get my body warm I be stand naked checking to see if my phone still work I will cut my hair short Trust me , I will I will let my beard go Trust me , I will I will never tempt fate not once , I swear I will never trust ice I will never trust a thing ___________________________________________________ name first reaction after Falling through the Ice Artist La Dispute album room of the House
