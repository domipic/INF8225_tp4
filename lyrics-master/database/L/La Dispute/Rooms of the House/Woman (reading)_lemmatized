you in the live room you on a Tuesday afternoon a breeze see when the curtain move you by the window with both foot up on the couch where you sit and you read and I watch you from the office , the sunlight frame your silhouette I think of light firework , I think of pirouette I idly write down observation on the scene like do the blueprint name the room alone ? do we name them on our own ? we hardly live in there you with a book prop on your knee a breeze see in your coffee steam I be in the office think back to rule of poetry , like it 's fourteen line , the last two rhyme , what do pentameter mean ? you in the living room Legs bent at forty-five degree I write AB AB try to find your rhyme scheme I look for object on the desk with which to sculpt your image best what would I name this , could I paint it ? Woman ( reading ) ? girl ( at rest ) ? I remember it so well watch you shift your weight turn the page I can see it all there inside a live room where only I live and never go in a role in name alone and I pause where I be for a second when I hear your name sometimes I think I see your face in improbable place do those moment replay for you ? when I be suddenly there and then wo n't go away when you be sit in the live room reading for the afternoon do you put your book down , look and try to find me there ? sometimes I think of all the people who live here before us how the space in the memory you make change the room from just blueprint to the place where you live when you leave here when you go from a home you take all that you own but the memory echo on hardwood floor in the living room Tore the carpet , the scratch below that we find and the wine stain on the couch we get drunk and decide we will still try to move it around and I ca n't tell what the difference be between the one that we make and the one that we do n't make they all conjure image still where you sit and you read in the sunlight , aware that I watch and I live alone now save for the echo I live alone now save for the echo _____________________ name Woman ( reading ) Artist La Dispute album room of the House
