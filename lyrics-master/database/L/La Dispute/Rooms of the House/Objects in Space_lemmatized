yesterday alone I lay everything out on the carpet book , kitchen thing , object with specific purpose or none arrange them sideways in a grid on the floor there unmoor out of context and then consider it first the whole picture , then everything individually hum along at the dead pace imaginable one object , then another , and then the next and I wonder what they mean there if they mean anything still find note camp supply a book you buy in the desert " identify Wildflowers " Pictures from vacation from party kitschy gift we buy from rest stop on that road trip out west object everything itself and then memory all of it lay out there from the dining room the live room the hallway and the basement and the kitchen from that room we call the office but never use even the bathroom everything lay out there on the floor , on the carpet , out of context and I sit there for hour today I move everything from the floor to the table in the dining room place each thing carefully without reason or at least without one I understand or could describe there on the table together and when I be do and step back I realize what I have make keepsake , picture , letter ordinary object all collect there a memorial and I think of one on highway or set by gravestone all the thing you see there but do n't understand but still bring a remember thing back vividly invoke someone 's reality when they be together in that place , in that way , out of context and I know I have to take it down before anybody else see tomorrow I plan to put them all somewhere those thing in box side of the road , attic maybe all these thing that push and pull me through history to place I once be place I might have go place I end up go postcard ticket stub from one thing or another a personalized coffee mug with neither your name nor mine phone card and old phone a page from an old calendar I buy once at a thrift store and insist on hang that cycle of the moon print photo , old boot of mine put them in box and I sit there for hour in the live room first then in the dining room move thing around Picking thing up and see where they take me to what place in history what moment on our timeline where we be , where I be where I think we will end up in this house or on the highway drive somewhere near Christmas in the desert or anywhere else and I put them in box ______________________ name object in Space Artist La Dispute album room of the House
