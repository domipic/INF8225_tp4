I meet a shell of a mountain who know she be finish claim she grow up from a grain of sand with every year wider she bloom a little bit longer to the roof of the sky with outstretch hand she make friend with the sun , share enemy with no one count week like she should of count day and swallow handful of night so she could sleep tight and turn her thought from its stone cold way and this be the beginning , the start of the ending you ca n't die from a break heart but from the time the sun rise to the space where it fall away she would love , and it would n't take part and every every day she would echo echo in every single way she should let go let go but it have her in its sight cupids icy arrow but so , so what so she catch every one with her heart like it be her duty it walk the wrong wrong way down her one way plan she be surround by forest , river and beauty until that glacier freeze over the land and so she blame herself hate her wealth she be bear at too young of an age and every night her dream be touch by witch finger until her heart be cage . with every morning spend not caring if she care or not sleep in the melt and mud , wait for the earth to rot bury herself alive she scrape the hole that it leave open empty as her very heart , that mountain be all break all break , that mountain be all break now I can see that her her blood 's red and she have get feeling and they always get spill both without think without thinking , without thinking , without thinking , I can see that her her blood 's red and she have get feeling and they always get spill both without think without thinking , they be n't think , without thinking , I can see that her her blood 's red and she have get feeling and they always get spill both without think without thinking , I be n't think , without thinking , I can see that our our blood 's red and we get feeling and we always spill both blood without think without thinking , what be we thinking , we be n't think , what be we think of ___________________________________ name Falling in Love with glacier Artist listener album Wooden Heart
