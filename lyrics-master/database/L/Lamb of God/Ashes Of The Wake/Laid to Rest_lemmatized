if there be a single day I could live a single breath I could take I will trade all the other away the blood be on the wall so you might as well just admit it and bleach out the stain commit to forget it you be well off empty and blank than leave with a single pathetic trace of this smother another failure Lay this to rest Console yourself you be well alone destroy yourself see who give a fuck absorb yourself you be well alone destroy yourself I will chain you to the truth for the truth shall set you free I will turn the screw of vengeance and bury you with honesty I will make all your dream come to life then slay them as quickly as they come smother another failure Lay this to rest Console yourself you be well alone destroy yourself see who give a fuck absorb yourself you be well alone destroy yourself see who give a fuck see who give a fuck see who give a fuck failure if there be a day I could live if there be a single breath I could take I will trade all the other away I will trade all the other away __________________ name lay to rest Artist Lamb of God album ash of the Wake
