I will be your thief in the night so I can steal you . I will be your church where you pray so I can heal you . I will be your lover where you lay so I can feel you . I will be your sunlight in your day so I can see you . oh , you will be my life when I be dead , I will be your calm in the storm ahead . you will be the beat in my heart , when there be none . you will be the air in my lung , when my breath be do . you will be the tear I ca n't cry , when you be weep . you be my only reason to keep from sleeping . oh , you will be my life when I be dead , I will be your calm in the storm ahead . tell my woman that I try to stay close , still by her side . you will be my life when I be dead , I will be your calm in the storm ahead . tell my woman that I try to stay close , still by her side . ___________________ name haunt Heart Artist Little Hurricane album Homewrecker
