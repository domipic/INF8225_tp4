I put on my good suit to come down and see you , I sit by your side every other day at a time and they say that I be crazy , they just ca n't see what you mean to me all I need be to be with you now that you be go , just ca n't move on for @card@ year , I have love you , my dear . and I miss you something terrible , this heartache be unbearable why will you go and leave me ? I want you back , my sweet pea I ca n't wear that same suit , out on the town without you wait to find that same look in her eye I find a new honey , but she will never mean what you mean to me you still be all of me . my heart feel wrong , life still go on . keep fight this pain , you be so far away . still miss you something terrible , this heartache be unbearable . why will you go and leave me ? I want you back , my sweet pea ______________ name Sweetpea Artist Little Hurricane album Homewrecker
