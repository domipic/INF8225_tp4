( I will blow you a kiss from across the room ) I will let it miss so you do n't assume ( please tell me that you want me and need me ) do n't matter if you do n't believe me ( I have no one to call me " baby " ) it sure be sad no one call you lately ( I try to run but I do n't know how to get there ) keep on run , you be go nowhere and you fear the sunrise will dry your eye , your crocodile tear ( I just need a man who will stay ) you can save it for a rainy day , you ( wo n't you help me get my life on track ? ) I will oblige but you stab me in back ( ride with me , I be head south ) I ca n't believe a single word from your mouth ( you and me be like biscuit and gravy ) now I know that you be crazy and you fear the sunrise will dry your eye , your crocodile tear , yea I ca n't believe a word you say , but you can save it for a rainy day well , hard to say not once , but twice no , you wa n't take your own advice . _____________________ name crocodile tear Artist Little Hurricane album Homewrecker
