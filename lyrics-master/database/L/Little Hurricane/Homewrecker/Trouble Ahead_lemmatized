they come and they burn the grass to the seed . everyone learn the sound of their foot . they will take what you earn or they steal what you keep . they will shut down the road , blockade the sea yeah they will watch out behind , trouble be come . look up ahead , start run . look out behind , trouble be come . watch up ahead , start run . the tree will all burn , ash fall like leaf . the storm 's grow cold , we can feel it in our knee . they will plan when you be calm or they will scheme while you sleep . they will look you in the eye while they chain your hand and foot . yeah they will watch out behind , trouble be come . look up ahead , start run . look out behind , trouble be come . watch up ahead , start run . watch out behind , trouble be come . look up ahead , start run . watch out behind , trouble be come . look up ahead , start run . watch out behind , trouble be come . watch up ahead , start run . look out behind , trouble be come . watch up ahead , start run . ___________________ name trouble ahead Artist Little Hurricane album Homewrecker
