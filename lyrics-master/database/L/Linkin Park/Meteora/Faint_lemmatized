I be a little bit of loneliness , a little bit of disregard a handful of complaint but I ca n't help the fact that everyone can see these scar I be what I want you to want , what I want you to feel but it be like no matter what I do I ca n't convince you to just believe this be real so I let go , watch you turn your back like you always do Face away and pretend that I be not but I will be here ' cause you be all that I get I ca n't feel the way I do before do n't turn your back on me ; I wo n't be ignore Time wo n't heal this damage anymore do n't turn your back on me ; I wo n't be ignore I be a little bit insecure , a little unconfident because you do n't understand I do what I can but sometimes I do n't make sense I be what you never want to say , but I have never have a doubt it be like no matter what I do I ca n't convince you for once just to hear me out so I let go , watch you turn your back like you always do Face away and pretend that I be not but I will be here because you be all that I get I ca n't feel the way I do before do n't turn your back on me ; I wo n't be ignore Time wo n't heal this damage anymore do n't turn your back on me ; I wo n't be ignore no , hear me out now you be gonna listen to me like it or not right now , hear me out now you be gonna listen to me like it or not right now I ca n't feel the way I do before do n't turn your back on me ; I wo n't be ignore I ca n't feel the way I do before do n't turn your back on me ; I wo n't be ignore Time wo n't heal this damage anymore do n't turn your back on me ; I wo n't be ignore I ca n't feel do n't turn your back on me ; I wo n't be ignore Time wo n't heal do n't turn your back on me ; I wo n't be ignore ___________ name faint Artist Linkin Park album Meteora
