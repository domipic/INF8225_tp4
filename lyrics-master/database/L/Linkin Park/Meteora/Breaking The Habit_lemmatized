memory consume like open the wound I be pick me apart again you all assume I be safe here in my room unless I try to start again I do n't want to be the one the battle always choose ' Cause inside I realize that I be the one confuse I do n't know what be worth fight for or why I have to scream I do n't know why I instigate and say what I do n't mean I do n't know how I get this way ; I know it be not alright so I be break the habit , I be break the habit tonight clutch my cure , I tightly lock the door I try to catch my breath again I hurt much more than anytime before I have no option leave again I do n't want to be the one the battle always choose ' Cause inside I realize that I be the one confuse I do n't know what be worth fight for or why I have to scream I do n't know why I instigate and say what I do n't mean I do n't know how I get this way , I will never be alright so I be break the habit , I be break the habit tonight I will paint it on the wall ' Cause I be the one at fault I will never fight again and this be how it end I do n't know what be worth fight for or why I have to scream but now I have some clarity to show you what I mean I do n't know how I get this way , I will never be alright so , I be break the habit , I be break the habit I be break the habit tonight ________________________ name break the habit Artist Linkin Park album Meteora
