' cause I ca n't justify the way everyone be look at me ( nothing to lose ) nothing to gain , hollow and alone and the fault be my own , and the fault be my own I want to heal , I want to feel what I think be never real I want to let go of the pain I have hold so long ( erase all the pain till it have go ) I want to heal , I want to feel like I be close to something real I want to find something I have want all along somewhere I belong I will never know myself until I do this on my own and I will never feel anything else until my wound be heal I will never be anything till I break away from me I will break away ; I will find myself today I want to heal , I want to feel what I think be never real I want to let go of the pain I have hold so long ( erase all the pain till it have go ) I want to heal , I want to feel like I be close to something real I want to find something I have want all along somewhere I belong ( I want to heal , I want to feel like I be ) somewhere I belong ( I want to heal , I want to feel like I be ) somewhere I belong somewhere I belong ________________________ name somewhere I belong Artist Linkin Park album Meteora
