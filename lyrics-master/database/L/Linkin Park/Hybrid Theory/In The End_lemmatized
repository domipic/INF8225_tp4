( it start with one ) one thing , I do n't know why it do n't even matter how hard you try keep that in mind ; I design this rhyme to explain , in due time all I know ; time be a valuable thing watch it fly by as the pendulum swing watch it count down to the end of the day the clock tick life away , it be so unreal do n't look out below watch the time go right out the window try to hold on , but do n't even know I waste it all just to watch you go I keep everything inside and even though I try , it all fall apart what it mean to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I try so hard and get so far but in the end , it do n't even matter I have to fall to lose it all but in the end , it do n't even matter one thing , I do n't know why it do n't even matter how hard you try keep that in mind ; I design this rhyme to remind myself how I try so hard in spite of the way you be mock me act like I be part of your property remember all the time you fight with me I be surprised it get so ( Far ) thing be n't the way they be before you would n't even recognize me anymore not that you know me back then but it all come back to me in the end you keep everything inside and even though I try , it all fall apart what it mean to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I try so hard and get so far but in the end , it do n't even matter I have to fall to lose it all but in the end , it do n't even matter I have put my trust in you , push as far as I can go for all this , there be only one thing you should know I have put my trust in you , push as far as I can go for all this , there be only one thing you should know I try so hard and get so far but in the end , it do n't even matter I have to fall to lose it all but in the end , it do n't even matter ________________ name in the End Artist Linkin Park album hybrid theory
