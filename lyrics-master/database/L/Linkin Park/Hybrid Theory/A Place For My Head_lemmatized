I want to be in another place I hate when you say you do n't understand ( you will see it be not mean to be ) I want to be in the energy , not with the enemy a place for my head . maybe someday I will be just like you and step on people like you do and run away all the people I think I know I remember back then who you be you use to be calm , use to be strong use to be generous , but you shoulda know that you will wear out your welcome and now you see how quiet it be , all alone .
