I wake up in a dream today to the cold of the static and put my cold foot on the floor forget all about yesterday remember I be pretend to be where I be not anymore a little taste of hypocrisy and I be leave in the wake of the mistake , slow to react E-even though you be so close to me you be still so distant and I ca n't bring you back it be true the way I feel be promise by your face the sound of your voice paint on my memory even if you be not with me I be with you you , now I see keep everything inside with you you , now I see even when I close my eye I hit you and you hit me back we fall to the floor the rest of the day stand still fine line between this and that when thing go wrong I pretend that the past be n't real I be trap in this memory and I be leave in the wake of the mistake slow to react so even though you be close to me you be still so distant and I ca n't bring you back it be true the way I feel be promise by your face the sound of your voice paint on my memory even if you be not with me I be with you you , now I see keep everything inside with you you , now I see even when I close my eye with you you , now I see keep everything inside with you you , now I see even when I close my eye no ! no matter how far we have come I ca n't wait to see tomorrow no matter how far we have come , I I ca n't wait to see tomorrow with you you , now I see keep everything inside with you you , now I see even when I close my eye with you you , now I see keep everything inside with you you , now I see even when I close my eye ______________ name with You Artist Linkin Park album hybrid theory
