my inside all turn to ash so slow and blow away as I collapse so cold a black wind take them away from sight and hold the darkness over day that night and the cloud above move closer look so dissatisfied but the heartless wind keep blow , blow I use to be my own protection but not now ' Cause my path have lose direction somehow a black wind take you away from sight and hold the darkness over day that night and the cloud above move closer look so dissatisfied and the ground below grow cold as they put you down inside but the heartless wind keep blow , blow so now you be go and I be wrong I never know what it be like to be alone on a valentine 's day on a valentine 's day on a valentine 's day on a valentine 's day on a valentine 's day ( I use to be my own protection ) on a valentine 's day ( but not now ) on a valentine 's day ( ' Cause my mind have lose direction ) on a valentine 's day ( somehow ) on a valentine 's day ( I use to be my own protection ) on a valentine 's day ( but not now ) on a valentine 's day ( ' Cause my mind have lose direction ) on a valentine 's day ( somehow ) . _____________________ name Valentine 's Day Artist Linkin Park album Minutes to midnight
