in this farewell , there be no blood , there be no alibi ' Cause I have draw regret from the truth of a thousand lie so let mercy come and wash away what I have do I will face myself to cross out what I have become erase myself and let go of what I have do put to rest what you think of me while I clean this slate with the hand of uncertainty so let mercy come , and wash away what I have do I will face myself to cross out what I have become erase myself and let go of what I have do for what I have do , I will start again and whatever pain may come today this end , I be forgive what I have do I will face myself to cross out what I have become erase myself and let go of what I have do ( Na-na-na-na , na-na-na-na , na-na-na-na , na-na-na-na ) what I have do ( Na-na-na-na , na-na-na-na , na-na-na-na , na-na-na-na ) forgive what I have do ( Na-na-na-na , na-na-na-na , na-na-na-na , na-na-na ) ____________________ name what I have Done Artist Linkin Park album Minutes to midnight
