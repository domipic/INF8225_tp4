here in this world I be awake with mistake , but it be love that keep fuel me , fuel me . pretty little lady with your swollen eye , would you show them to me ? I know I be not that perfect , but you stay a while , Baby , then you will see . mile away I can still feel you , Lay your head down on my embrace , my embrace . far away . pretty little lady with your swollen eye , would you show them to me ? I know I be not that perfect , but you stay a while , Baby , then you will see . do n't give up baby , I know that it be shaky , just let love consume us , consume us . here in this world I be awake with mistake , but it be love that keep fuel me . fuel me , to love you . mile away I can still feel you Lay your head down on my embrace . be not afraid , to love me . pretty little lady with your swollen eye , would you show them to me ? I know I be not that perfect , but you stay a while , Baby , then you will see . ___________________________________ name when you can n't sleep at night artist of mouse & Men album the Flood
