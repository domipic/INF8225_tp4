I be all for you , you fall over my love , I just ca n't afford it this time . here be a story , just bare with me , Met a drug that change my life . something like a classic movie , just one look , all stop with time . let her in through these very vein , course through these tired bone . numb my body , heal my heart , soothe my mind , and ease my soul . these be the memory between us , let it go , and let live again . I be all for you , you fall over my love , I just ca n't afford it this time . I be all for you , you fall over my love , I just ca n't afford it this time . you let me live , believe all your life . you let me live your lie , live your lie . you let me believe , and live your lie . guess I should have see this come , should have know it all along . you be a fake , see clear right through you , leave me die , it be all your fault . these be the memory between us , let it go , and let live again . I be all for you , you fall over my love , I just ca n't afford it this time . I be all for you , you fall over my love , I just ca n't afford it this time . I give you everything , and you just throw away . know what I deserve , know that I should let , let you go ... ; let you go ! this be me , let you go ... ; I be all for you , you fall over my love , I just ca n't afford it this time . I be all for you , you fall over my love , now I be leave with thought of suicide ... ; let you go , you be kill me . ______________ name let live artist of mouse & Men album the Flood
