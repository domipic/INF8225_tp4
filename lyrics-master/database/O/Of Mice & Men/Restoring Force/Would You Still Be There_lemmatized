if I could find the word if I could shake the world if I could turn back time would you still be there ? I ca n't stop think about the way I leave you sink with no escape now there be no lifeline , no way to save but maybe next time I wo n't throw it all away I ask myself everyday if I could find the word if I could shake the world if I could turn back time would you still be there ? ( be there ? ) if I could find the word to say if I could shake the world to break you down then would you still be there ? ( be there ? ) ( would you still be there ? ) ( would you still be there ? ) dislocate , I lie awake suffocate in my mistake I lose my halo when I fall from grace but maybe next time I wo n't throw it all away I ask myself everyday if I could find the word if I could shake the world if I could turn back time would you still be there ? ( be there ? ) if I could find the word to say if I could shake the world to break you down then would you still be there ? ( would you still be there ? ) there be no dancing around it I crawl into the fire and fan the flame and I ca n't stand it ( and I ca n't stand it ) but I do n't have the strength to burn the page if I could find the word if I could shake the world if I could turn back time would you still be there ? ( be there ? ) if I could find the word ( to say ) if I could shake the world ( to break ) if I could turn back time would you still be there ? ( be there ? ) if I could find the word to say if I could shake the world to break you down then would you still be there ? ( would you still be there ? ) ______________________________ name would you still be there artist of mouse & Men album restore Force
