do you ever contemplate when all be lose you hesitate and nothing seem the same ? have you ever hide your face , in such disgrace , decision make , a picture with no frame ? can you hold on ? one more day ? say you be okay , I be afraid that tomorrow be just too far away . fight the pain , it just feel like forever be crash down on me ( down on me , me , me ) . rain will fall . wash all the pain . it shield the soul , you turn the page to face another day . let me know that you will wait and I will pay for my mistake to feel the sun again . can you hold on ? say you be okay , I be afraid that tomorrow be just too far away . fight the pain , it just feel like forever be crash down on me . do n't let go , time will heal . just do n't let go , one day we can try to start again . say you be okay , I be afraid that tomorrow be just too far away . fight the pain , it just feel like forever , forever . it feel like forever be crash down on me ( down on me , me , me ) . ________________________ name feel like forever artist of mouse & Men album restore Force
