open your shelter and let us all in tired and homeless be hungry again outside my window at fountain and vine drunk and the addict be form a line share their story to comfort dispair Carry the weight of the crosse they bear pray for courage and wisdom to change Serenity cost more than pocket book change I want to tear down the wall and shatter the image that fall I want to turn all the table and give back what do n't belong to me , yeah sleep on sidewalk be how people live beg for something no one want to give size of your wealth be a bottle of wine sip with your friend you will soon leave behind be your child in flame , incarcerate and bind by the chain ? stranger paralyze down in the gutter of fountain and vine I want to tear down the wall and shatter the image that fall I want to turn all the table and give back what do n't belong to me , yeah feel like run away , like run away tired of see them fall aside there be no run away I be run , I be run away I want to tear it all down build it all up from the ground I want to tear down the wall and shatter the image that fall on me the view from down here bring mention to mind everything be sacred on fountain and vine _____________________ name Fountain & Vine Artist oleander album joyride
