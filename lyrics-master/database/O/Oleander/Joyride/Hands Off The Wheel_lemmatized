do n't , do n't it make you sad to lose the thing you love for what you never have ? do n't , do n't it make you cry to feel the break time and always wonder why ? do n't it make you feel like your hand be off the wheel , like your hand be off the wheel ? do n't it tear you down , do n't it turn your world around , do n't it love to let you down ? do n't , do n't it make your day to gather up your strength and feel it slip away ? how , how much can you take before you fall apart , before you start to break ? do n't it make you feel like your hand be off the wheel , like your hand be off the wheel ? do n't it tear you down , do n't it turn your world around , do n't it love to let you down ? close your eye , it be only no surprise you be not alone . do n't it make you sad to lose the one you love ? do n't it make you feel like your hand be off the wheel , like your hand be off the wheel ? do n't it tear you down , do n't it turn your world around do n't it love to let you down ? do n't it make you feel , do n't it make you feel like it be carry you down , down , down , down ... like your hand be off the wheel , like your hand be off the wheel . _________________________ name Hands off the wheel artist oleander album joyride
