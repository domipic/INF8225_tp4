there be a voice call for me there be a light come down on me there be a doubt that be clear there be a day that be dawn there be a wound that be heal there be a season wait for me there be a road that be turn there be a fire still burn a sickness in me Constant pace towards the end the need be stronger this time the need be deep there be a peace I be search there be a freedom I be depend on there be a pain that be never end there be a rain fall only on me there be a dream I be live there be a life I be dream of there be a death I be await there be a home I be desert I hold my breath and wait only moment remain movement for departed hope effect for absent friend Sever the faith from my body leave me beg for more take what I have and deliver me into everlasting sleep soothe trance colour fade and disappear ethereal light show me what I can do without in a motionless scene there be only me I take what I can control you to get ahead fade away and leave long for sleep closer now Lead the way into death every wretched dream I have leave behind every wake hour I lie in wait suck inside by will go into the flood all my question unfurl as I be put to the test once I be below there be no turn back plunge into the deep void depart shell leave drain behind pace road unknown Searching for a new home Desert in my eye Barren land inside __________________________ name Master 's apprentice Artist Opeth album deliverance
