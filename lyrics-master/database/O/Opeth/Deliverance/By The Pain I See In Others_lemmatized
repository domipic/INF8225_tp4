let me taste let me feel I need to know what you keep inside no need to speak just let it be Carry out this wish for me let nothing interfere rise to submission I be still beneath in the soil discard your clothes let loose you hair we be intertwine forever and have always be say the word and I will depart upon your lip dwell nothing but the meaning of my cause rise to submission I be still beneath in the soil and so come the dark vibrant as ever before flower already wither in this endless winter of soul Outside in the park the day move along and nothing ever change they have nothing on us and we have always know that nothing ever change rise to submission I be still beneath in the soil this be ours alone Feeding off the warmth lure out from inside depend on the life blood rise to submission I be still beneath in the soil this be ours alone Feeding off the warmth lure out from inside silently whisper move in me and set me free " Htaed otni yaw eht Dael Won resolc Peels rof gnol Gnivael dna Yawa gnidaf Tuohtiw od Nac I Tahw Em Gniwohs Thgil Laerehte Raeppasid Dna Edaf Sruoloc Ecnart Gnihtoos " _________________________________ name by the Pain I See in Others Artist Opeth album deliverance
