float on mist creep up the cavern of my brain Receiving no warning from nothing to a life code walk with me , you will never leave wait to see your spirit free tell me how your heart be in need as I drown you in the sea unwind snare of distrust your wrist in my face grip look me in the eye , I be clear this be your time Face down beneath the waterline gaze into the deep from love to death in a time span of second oblivious to regret push into belief in liquid cellophane gasp for air Mercy in my eye be the shade of the night the piercing sound you make soar high , higher now and once leave in my wake your memory be nothing but the scar on me all over now forget why I need this Standing down disappear into the obscure resting day wait for new disease bide time look inside insanity it always burn within the downward spiral never end when drive into sin your salvation be find in a sinner 's deed the devil guide the day tell me what to say pour himself inside and snuff the final light deliverance throw back at me deliverance laugh at me _________________ name deliverance Artist Opeth album deliverance
