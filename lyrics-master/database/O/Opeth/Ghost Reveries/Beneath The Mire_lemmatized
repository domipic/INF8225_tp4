haunted night for halcyon day can n't sleep to the scrape of his voice nature 's way strike grief in me and I become a ghost in sickness willingly guide into heresy beneath the surface , stark emptiness and you will pity my conviction whereas I think of myself as a leader you will cling to your pleasant hope it be twisted fascination while I will ruin the obstacle into despair and I be praise death lose love of the heart in a holocaust scene memory decrepit body wear transparent skin Inside , the smoke of failure weep for solace and submit to faith in his shadow I be choke yet flourish Master a delusion make me strong yet I be drape in pale wither flesh I sacrifice more than I have and leave my woe beneath the mire ______________________ name beneath the Mire Artist Opeth album ghost reverie
