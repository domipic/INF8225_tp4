I hear the bay of the hound in the distance . I hear them devour Pest-ridden jackal of the earth diabolical beast and roam the forest in wait and constant protector call you to sit by his side your self-loathing image in his flesh a revelation upon which you linger his word be fly swarm towards the true insect feast on bury dream and spread decay upon your skin his eye spew forth a darkness that cut through and paralyze cast light upon your secret force to confront your enemy his mouth be a vortex suck you into its pandemonium fool you with a help hand of ash reach out in false dismay his body be a country the city lie dead beyond despair friend turn enemy unable to come clean in a rise fog of reek death everything you believe be a lie everyone you love be a death-burden so you take comfort in him and you be receptive to stark wish no longer struggle to declare your stand you would inflict no harm to other they be unaware and in a loop of futile event you be everything , they be nothing Drown in the deep mire with past desire beneath the mire Drown desire now with you line up verse on dead skin the tainted lip of a stranger rest upon hers and I embrace bereavement everything beloved be shatter anyway I would devote myself to anyone I would accept any flaw I be too weak to resist tension vibrate with horror find the outcast in my eye push nerve on a puppet Endless poison in my vein clean intent now taint with death and so , cold touch now inhumane every wake hour await a reverie to unfold Louder by the minute the bay of the hound call me back to my home ______________________________ name the bay of the hound Artist Opeth album ghost reverie
