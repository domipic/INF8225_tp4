there be a sense of longing in me as I read Rosemary 's letter her writing 's honest can n't forget the year she be lose in isolation she talk about her love and as I read " I will die alone " I know she be ache there be a certain detail see here the pen must have slip to the side and leave a stain next to his name she Knows he be go and isolation be all that would remain " the wound in me be pour out to rest on a lover 's shore " _____________________ name isolation year Artist Opeth album ghost reverie
