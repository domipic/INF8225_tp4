majesty faithful me Pour yourself into me wield your power Martyr 's price Stare me down to the ground the eye of the devil fix on his sinner slake my thirst eternal wealth heathen key Round my neck this poetry of blasphemy know the sound of infamy the hand of Satan assemble his flock Pale horse Rider search the earth whisper conjuration , a belief take form choke hand tap the vein in your throat his order in your mouth , a decree for domination beneath the tide of wisdom , spin the undertow of hate inject seed of vengeance , usurper 's eye of the powerless clean path to his kingdom beckon in the mist the grand conjuration tell me why Love subside in the light of your wish say my name ease the pain Clear the smoke in my head ___________________________ name the Grand conjuration Artist Opeth album ghost reverie
