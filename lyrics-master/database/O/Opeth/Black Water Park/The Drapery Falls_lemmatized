please remedy my confusion and thrust me back to the day the silence of your seclusion bring night into all you say pull me down again and guide me into pain I be count nocturnal hour drown vision in haunted sleep faint flicker of your power Leaks out to show what you keep pull me down again and guide me into ... there be failure inside this test I ca n't persist keep back by the enigma no criterias demand here deadly pattern make my wreath prosperous in your way Pale ghost in the corner pour a caress on your shoulder Ooh , puzzle by shrewd innocence run a thick tide beneath usher into inner grave Nails bleed from the struggle it be the end for the weak at heart always the same A lullaby for the one who have lose all reel inside gleam eye in your necklace reflect Stare of primal regret you turn your back and you walk away never again spiral to the ground below like autumn leaf leave in the wake to fade wake up to your sound again and lapse into the way of misery _______________________ name the drapery Falls Artist Opeth album Black Water Park
