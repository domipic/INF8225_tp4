you wait by the window morning 's breath on the sill idle hand give another try so you wait and you savour the moment outside the canvas turn white Ruby eye in the fog Rain wash clean all the sin a liquid gown that cover all your loathe turn endless open mirage soothe your sense lock on the pinnacle the good secret within like a derelict child Heart burning for a stranger ascend to the meek Flock round the liar in awe cake in the soil beneath Fear me when we meet turn away in admiration my firm grip around the nucleus of joy enough of this you will leave me now you will see it now Perish at my hand close to you tangle up in hair Fresh stigma look Shall I take you with me and it be cold Ruby eye in the fog it be me and you be just like them all stain by the name of father I be greet my downward fall leave the throes to other and you be just like them all stain by the name of father I be greet my downward fall leave the throes to other __________________________ name the funeral portrait Artist Opeth album Black Water Park
