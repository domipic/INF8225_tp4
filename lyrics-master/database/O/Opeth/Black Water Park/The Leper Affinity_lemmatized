we enter Winter once again naked , freezing from my breath Neath the lid all limb tuck away this coffin be your abode from now and onwards your body be mine to avail such a tragic sight you be slave under my creed spur me with those tear I be beyond death midst a dream affinity save strength now , faint whisper come erotic communion in its splendour fever mirror ghost night time consolation , cross the line draw murder into art sleep inside through day in the wake of this relief shiver , longing for more insanity at its peak love me to my death lose be day of Spring you sight and let me in keep the beast inside shackle within my hide scream out too late lose to my hate Grew together with your skin and pace the trail of sin your gaze cover in virgin snow rigid feature it be the shallow deed who be to blame deafen shriek pierce the night a step from oblivion move into the dim light hide within a reverie it be worth it for the wait alone your body be mine to avail such a tragic sight you be slave under my creed spur me with those tear ________________________ name the leper affinity Artist Opeth album Black Water Park
