and so you leave us jaded and gaunt , some September wilt with the season but hide inside the delusion I see your eye , somewhere Devoid of death the aura poise amidst ( the storm ) in solid tear I linger a parlour glade , moonlit sorrow lonely resting pool relic of the moon-dogged lake whisper : " all your word be misgive " be I like them ? those who mourn and turn away those who would give anything to see you again if only for another second your face be , like the photograph paint white we do not speak very often about it what do it matter now ? cloak of autumn shroud I gaze , dim ricochet of star I reckon it be time for me to leave you sleep in the light yet the night and the silent water still so dark ____________________________________ name the night and the silent Water Artist Opeth album Morningrise
