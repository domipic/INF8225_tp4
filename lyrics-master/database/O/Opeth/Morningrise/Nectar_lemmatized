I arise from the lullaby endure yet another tale you tempt me again with your embrace , so taint within the night you beckon curse me with every glance Bring me through Carry my empty shadow and guide me inside your warp labyrinth to the well of sin I swear I will always love you leave me speechless release my yearning the soil I walk be clad with light drift moon thrust me with their ray and I fall inside I lament this heritage can bid farewell the pale face ... you go as far as you could and from that moment I witness your beauty , fealt your death mine be yours , mine be yours in the wake of dawn the mist of morning linger before it leave invisible eye , red reflection it be you smile in the midst of the moor ____________ name nectar Artist Opeth album Morningrise
