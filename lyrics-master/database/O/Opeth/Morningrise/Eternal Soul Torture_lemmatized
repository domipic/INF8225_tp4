the deceased awake from beyond their sleep . search for blood and mortal meat . maggot crawl out from their eye . feel their pain , it be mournful cry . pull your vein , tear out your heart . consume the blood , feast on flesh . tear apart , intestine scatter . alimentary canal rip and shatter . piece of your body eat . painful death as time stand still . where your mind burst in torture . feel your soul be tear apart . demon crawl through your system . hell have rise , the god of pain . rip your skin , burn your bone . internal organ tear and drain . smell of flesh burn to ash . cry of death from hell . pain be all you revolve around . where the soul of Satan 's ground . room of eternal torture , reveal endurance of endless pain . disintegrate mortal , body burn . there you feel the hellish torture . hellish torment , brutal butcher . demonic creature revolve in torment ... __________________________ name eternal soul torture Artist Opeth album Morningrise
