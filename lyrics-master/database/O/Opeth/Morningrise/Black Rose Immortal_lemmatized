in the name of desperation I call your name a lamentation I sigh again and again spiritual eclipse the gateway be close for me to seek the night ... a veil of star , watch my shadow be bear from light the light of the eye , in darkness over troubled water memory soar endlessly , search night and day the moonlight caress a lonely hill with the calmness of a whisper I wear a naked soul a blank face in the stream water it be cold in here Frost scar my coat with dust eye attach to your mute portrait we speak only through thought together we gaze , await hour bring thirst and the rise sun sunbird leave their dark recess shadow glid the archway do not turn your face towards me confront me with my lonliness you be in a forest unknown the secret orchard and your voice be vast and achromatic but still so precious lullaby of the crescent moon take you mesmerize , its kaleidoscopic face grant you a hollow stare another soul within the divine herd I have keep it the amaranth symbol Hidden inside the golden shrine until we rejoice in the meadow of the end when we both walk the shadow it will set ablaze and vanish Black rise immortal it be get dark again dusk shuffle across the field the evening tree moan as if they know at night I always dream of you _________________________ name Black Rose immortal Artist Opeth album Morningrise
