it be all true a parlour stride , and the night set forever I stray in the quiet cold and you gird me when I dare to listen elastic meadow , endless arm of sorrow lip try to form " because " try to adapt to the wilderness where even foe close their eye and leave we be inside the glade every now and then I wipe the dust aside to remember ... how I drape my face with my bare hand the same that bring me here but you be beyond all help the fold message that weep my name shadow skulk at my come we survey the slope in search for the word to write the missing page the tainted dogma time grow short as the piper play his tune we be almost there you be beyond all help dancing into the void we be almost there ____________ name advent Artist Opeth album Morningrise
