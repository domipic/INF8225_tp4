the liquid be in your throat one hopeless delight after all you fall in love with death , Life have abort . all you have have and all you become , the night be call , you pray for it . a barren waste be your land your crop , they be sow to die the skin be a mirror empty eye hollow with ignorance Health run from your lip tuck in and safe in a world of sleep all those year care for a liar a benefit road that be wind high you be a moth too close to the fire you be stick in a route of confusion change and wait and seek the truth of it all flee your sorrow push your spirit away the weakness of the psyche a whisper from the heart of evil lure them all into despair resent the good of a savior and cry out for the restless will also die a selection cull from the damned , draw a lifeline of one a friend die in your room and seek the birth of a follower O brother , you be a killer and you target yourself I wish you have never come back for us to see the beckon end and the pride of a mother bring flaw in a mother 's son and the love from a father be use by a father 's son overhear us talk in a smoke of lose hope the language of a parting so clear and so true overhear us talk _____________________ name the Lotus eater Artist Opeth album watershed
