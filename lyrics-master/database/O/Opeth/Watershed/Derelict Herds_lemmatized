someone die for look too far while I be asleep in my house a child be kill , I hear it from a friend a war rage in a distant land cause me to linger on a piece of text someone die not here , never here there be a fever there be a failure be you a believer ? then someone lie to you you hold it close to your chest there be a meaning for this test but you forget and it be go now you be control somehow there be a mean time an invitation of sort I remember life I , I be sick with sorrow I have fall asleep and dream of my sin here it be your turn adamant smile and say , " thank you " there be a sickness right in the family while I shudder in the cold Woman hang for her sin while I crave mine an old man drown in this life herd as I make amends with my father someone die not here , never here ____________________ name derelict herd Artist Opeth album watershed
