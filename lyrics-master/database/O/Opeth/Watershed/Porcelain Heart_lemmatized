I lose all I have ( that April day ) I turn to my friend ( nothing to say ) I write down a name ( and read it twice ) I wallow in shame ... I say that I love ( eternal scheme ) I cling to my past ( like childish dream ) I promise to stay ( and hold my breath ) I go far away ... icy road beneath my foot Lead me through wasteland of deceit rest your head now - do n't you cry do n't ever ask the reason why keep inside our idle race ghost of an idol 's false embrace rest your head now - do n't you cry do n't ever ask the reason why _____________________ name porcelain Heart Artist Opeth album watershed
