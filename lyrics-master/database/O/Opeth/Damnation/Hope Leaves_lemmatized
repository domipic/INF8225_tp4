in the corner beside my window there hang a lonely photograph there be no reason I will never notice a memory that could hold me back there be a wound that be always bleeding there be a road I be always walk and I know you will never return to this place go through day without talk there be a comfort in silence so use to lose all ambition struggle to maintain what be left there be a wound that be always bleeding there be a road I be always walk and I know you will never return to this place once undo there be only smoke burning in my eye to blind to cover up what really happen Force the darkness unto me there be a wound that be always bleeding there be a road I be always walk and I know you will never return to this place _________________ name Hope leave Artist Opeth album damnation
