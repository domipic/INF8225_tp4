out on the road there be firefly circle deep in the wood where the lose soul hide over the hill there be man return try to find some peace of mind oh sleep my child Oh sleep my child Oh sleep my child Oh sleep my child Oh under the fog there be shadow moving do n't be afraid hold my hand into the dark there be eyelid close bury alive in the shift sand oh sleep my child Oh sleep my child Oh sleep my child Oh sleep my child Oh speak to me now and the world will crumble open a door and the moon will fall all of your life all your memory go to your dream , forget it all oh sleep my child Oh sleep my child Oh sleep my child Oh sleep my child Oh _______________________________ name death whisper a lullaby Artist Opeth album damnation
