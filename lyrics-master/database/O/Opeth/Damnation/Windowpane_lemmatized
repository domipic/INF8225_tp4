blank face in the windowpane make clear in second of light disappear and return again count hour , search the night might be wait for someone might be there for us to see might be in need of talk might be stare directly at me inside play a lullaby slur voice over child cry on the inside haunting loneliness in the eye skin cover a secret scar his hand be wave a goodbye there be no response or action return there be deep prejudice in me outshine all reason inside give dream all riddle with pain and project unto the last ________________ name windowpane Artist Opeth album damnation
