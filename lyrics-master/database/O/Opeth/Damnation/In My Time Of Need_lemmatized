I ca n't see the meaning of this life I be lead , I try to forget you as you forget me , this time there be nothing leave for you to take , this be goodbye Summer be mile and mile away and no one would ask me to stay and I should contemplate this change to ease the pain and I should step out of the rain turn away close to end it all I be drift through the stage of the rapture bear within this loss , thought of death inside tear me apart from the core of my soul Summer be mile and mile away and no one would ask me to stay and I should contemplate this change to ease the pain and I should step out of the rain turn away at time the Dark be fade slowly but it never sustain would someone watch over me in my time of need Summer be mile and mile away and no one would ask me to stay and I should contemplate this change to ease the pain and I should step out of the rain turn away ________________________ name in my time of need Artist Opeth album damnation
