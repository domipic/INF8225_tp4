find you there in the blink of an eye I miss you turn away into a thousand dream find out what they mean lose you there in a moment of truth I trust you Gave away the one and only heart a gift to tear apart Stain me save me take me to my home hold me show me take me to my home weak now draw fluid from me you kill me I be not afraid of what you have just do but of what you have just become ______________ name weakness Artist Opeth album damnation
