no thought be give to the consequence , just a need to see what might become , it be like we need to sabotage all of the love in our life to prove control be so far from undo . and I , I have cave in again but I , I be build from the wreckage . we bend , we break , we be force to heal , the toll it take in time reveal . I choose the shot to usher in deliverance , Flood away the past I ca n't tow , but like the river weather stone it shape and wither my home , to a place I barely know . we bend , we break , we be force to heal , the toll it take in time reveal , the trial in wake of it create or tear us down , we bend , we break , we learn to heal . failing be clay for mason hand to shape , so strike away the grip of past mistake . and I , I have cave in again but I , I , I have cave in again but . we bend , we break , we be force to heal , the toll it take in time reveal , the trial in wake of it create or tear us down , we bend , we break , we learn to heal . failing be clay for mason hand to shape , so strike away the grip of past mistake . _______________ name the Mason Artist Wovenwar album Wovenwar
