I watch the wonder creep over all the wall we have make , ( a tragic sly cascade ) and I watch it flood away the light from any candle 's flame , ( with wick entwine of late ) can n't keep a fire in rain . and the bad of it all be that you know me , and you know that I will fall for it every time , when we collide it be death to right . sooner or later we will find new wind to carry home , ( the heart we turn to stone ) and i pray theyre strong enough to weather gem from cinder coal , ( that you have leave to smoke ) burn out before the stoke . and the bad of it all be that you know me , and you know that I will fall for it every time , when we collide it be death to right . how many will we leave wonder ? how many will we leave wonder ? it start we never finish and end we never start , how many life will break upon our callous heart , will break upon our callous heart . and the bad of it all be that you know me , and you know that I will fall for it every time , when we collide it be death to right . _____________________ name death to Rights Artist Wovenwar album Wovenwar
