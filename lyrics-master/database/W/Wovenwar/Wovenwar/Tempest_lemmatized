I be watch them all fly by , reach the great height my dream find , I be need first a leap to climb . I await the day the star wo n't seem so far away , and greet a sun the darken cloud have keep at bay , but until then , until then . my wing they unfold in a storm gale , the tempest call for my flight to fail , when gravity beckon with its hold , in spite of ' all the horizon send wind to take me home . I will build my throne from break bone , defeat I have know and deed ive leave untold , my story be the storm . I await the day the star wo n't seem so far away , and greet a sun the darken cloud have keep at bay , but until then , until then . my wing they unfold in a storm gale , the tempest call for my flight to fail , when gravity beckon with its hold , in spite of ' all the horizon send wind to take me home . I have see them shine see them rise and fall , yet keep my course and fare through it all . my wing they unfold in a storm gale , the tempest call for my flight to fail , when gravity beckon with its hold , in spite of ' all the horizon send wind to take me home . _____________ name Tempest Artist Wovenwar album Wovenwar
