we have plant a seed , an ever grow wonder to a beautiful tree . grow . each branch outstretch and different from the last . where the old have break , some easy than the last . the right one have grow in to fill in the gap . and all be equal in love and trust . and all be a part of something so much big than this . through the trial our tongue be tie , to try time , so many unsaid line . our life be over at so many moment , so many . and now they be all just begin . I have never be so consume and I have never love it more . to be devote to let all see what it be to live in the love of other . to live in the love of my brother . and spill back all that anyone have ever spill for me . to show that to those who have never see . four year ago we plant a seed . find that foundation that we need . strive for the perfect balence , to show love and show compassion . and our vision for this world will not die when we be dead . my future start with the first note that I ever play . the first note that be ever sing . when we start live with purpose and write with meaning . this be what we be make for . every day I live this future . _____________________ name to Plant a Seed Artist we come as Romans album Equal Vision Records present : New sound @card@
