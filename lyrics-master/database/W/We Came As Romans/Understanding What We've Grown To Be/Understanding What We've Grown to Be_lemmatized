all the light , be too bright to see the spark that I have be miss for too long . something I have be miss for too long . my empty cup , could never fill another . I have spill all I have have to make thing well . but the love of all other , have make me new . my empty cup , could never because of you fill another . I be make new , I have spill all I have have , because of you to make thing well . I be make new . we have all be break so let us make each other new . so let us make each other new . I have die inside every time I try to lie to myself about feel alive , alive . to lie to myself about feel alive , alive . I have die . all the light , be too bright to see the spark that I have be miss for too long . something I have be miss for too long . all these distraction , keep me from see what I need all along , an understanding . I be speechless tonight as I stare into the sky . I feel endless compassion , forgiveness , and love , I feel everyone who be look up share this , I feel unexplainably alive . I need to understand what we have grow to be . tonight , when I look into the sky I know this be why I be alive . tonight , when I look into the sky I know this be why I be alive . so sing with me if you feel this feeling . so sing with me if you feel this feeling . I be alive . __________________________________________ name understand what we have grow to be artist we come as Romans album understand what we have grow to be
