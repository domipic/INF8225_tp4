we be design for more . in an image not our own . but we have fall short . I be quite speechless and be quite unaware . of what the capability of a weak heart be . we be cast away . it will run through the back of your head until you regain control again . the sleep lose on these thought be n't worth the time . we be cast away until we regain control again . this year of you hold near or not at all . it be n't worth the wait . we be all cast away . we be design for more . in an image not our own . but we have fall short . we be so close . it be just not worth it to stay in this state . it be just not worth it to keep it . it be just not worth it to let it go . I believe in a good condition . in one that I have yet to attain . I believe in a good love . in one that have yet to change . the love that I feel from my brother be the sun in the sky . I will find my condition in that which be unconditional . conversation . ours be never , you be ever so convincing they will get well . it be just not worth it to stay in this state . I believe in a good condition . in one I have yet to attain . I believe in a good love . in one that have yet to change . fill me with faith . I wo n't be cast away . ________________ name condition artist we come as Romans album dream
