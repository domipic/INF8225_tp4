there be two type of man on our Mother Earth some have all the luck , some just live in dirt here be several type of the color of the skin but what be crucial be to lose or win you feel so alive where the eagle cry and you feel so strong on a mountain high but in fact you be at his bottom just his unattainable top seem to be a must we will stay down , we will stay down , we will stay down , down where we belong we will stay down , we will stay down , we will stay down , down where we belong and the rain keep knock on our Mother Earth and the snow keep fall , be it really worth to live through this ache and to die at last when you be predestine and the die be cast ? our thought be fade in a time that melt our flesh be fade as we have always feel but we kid ourselves to meet heaven 's feast to rise up to God and to be release we will stay down , we will stay down , we will stay down , down where we belong we will stay down , we will stay down , we will stay down , down where we belong you belong to us , to the human crap which will never win and succumb in traps that be set by other with deceitfulness and you stumble into them with thankfulness no one know if we be to survive the storm but I tell you man you be just a worm just a little error on a hopeless crust you be sleazy man and your limb will rust we will stay down , we will stay down , we will stay down , down where we belong we will stay down , we will stay down , we will stay down , down where we belong __________________________ name down where we belong Artist Wumpscut album Embryodead
