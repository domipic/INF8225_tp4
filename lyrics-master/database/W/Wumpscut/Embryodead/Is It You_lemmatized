here in the dark be no light at all , no orientation , no shadow fall . here in the dark I reach out for you , sense fear . have I lose you ? be it you ? be it you ? I see no way out . I just hear your voice . it seem so dead , too cold for you , too cold for you to be alive . I hesitate to trust your voice . sound so unreal , it sound like if somebody force you . be it you ? be it you ? my hand stretch out , now I feel your hand . it be motionless . oh my god , it be dead ! the light be on now , the devil jeer at me . he drag your corpse across barbed hook and take away my soul with laughter . be it you ? be it you ? be it you ? be it you ? be it you ? be it you ? _______________ name be it you Artist Wumpscut album Embryodead
