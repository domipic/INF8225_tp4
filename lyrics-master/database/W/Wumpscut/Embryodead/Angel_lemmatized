Angel , come to me , to me , come to me . Angel , belong to me , to me , belong to me . Angel , you have wing , to fly , fly to me . Angel , do you doubt ? no need to have doubt . Angel , feel my love , my love for you , feel my love for you . Angel , carry me , to you , to your home , to paradise . Angel , I would lie for you , for you , just for you , with my yearning heart . and angel , I would die for you , for you , just for you , with my burning heart . Angel , do n't feel liable for me and my pain , do n't feel liable . ' cause angel must be free , high up from this world in eternity . Angel , I could clip your wing to catch all your love , to calm your pain . but Angel , this would be so wrong , you would bleed to death immediately ! so Angel , come to me , heal my glaring pain voluntarily . I love you . ___________ name Angel Artist Wumpscut album Embryodead
