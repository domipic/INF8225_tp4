this army of inspiration we come for our revenge we will raise the flag of discontent , we know who we be and where we stand , I know word ca n't change the world but they can have an impact on life through some word that someone else write I find hope , and hope be all we have . why sing another empty anthem ? when you know this world need direction . hope be all we have . the hollow word you say we both know they mean nothing we know that your heart be hollow we know that your word be shallow but those word be all we have . _______________________ name Famous last word Artist Walls of Jericho album the American dream
