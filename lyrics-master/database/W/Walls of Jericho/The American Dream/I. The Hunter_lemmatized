I be a monster inside a man the outer shell be my good half method of madness have no end when you hunt the dead an urge , strong urge I ca n't resist and they will only set me free to run again I be a wolf a killer alone I stand all you see be my mask of sanity , a true mistery the wolf will strike again my dream will prey on you I promise this will set you free close your eye and wait for it the warm crimson freedom will wash you clean your body will rot beneath the concrete I be a wolf a killer alone I stand all you see be my mask of sanity a true mistery the wolf will strike again ___________________ name I . the Hunter Artist Walls of Jericho album the American dream
