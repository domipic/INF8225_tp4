the tear come strong again . I be n't ready for your time to end . I swear i will tear this world apart to save you . I think about that day . I will do anything to forget the pain . but the sky burn and the flower die , the flower die in May . I ca n't do this without you . if I could hold you one more time I will never let you go . I ca n't do this without you . if I could tell you one more time , that I love you . I close my eye . I see your face . I hold you in my heart . angel , your my guardian . I sing this song so you will live on forever . like a storm that rage on a woman that would not back down . the day you leave will always burn , burn inside my soul . I ca n't do this without you . if I could hold you one more time I will never let you go . I ca n't do this without you . if I could tell you one more time , that I love you . I close my eye . I see your face . I ca n't do this without you . if I could hold you one more time I will never let you go . I ca n't do this without you . if I could tell you one more time , that I love you . I close my eye . I see your face . I close my eye . I see your face . _________________ name ember Drive Artist Walls of Jericho album redemption
