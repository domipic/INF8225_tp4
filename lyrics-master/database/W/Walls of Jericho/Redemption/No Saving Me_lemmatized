inside these break line a disruption of our life insanity kick in and all I see be another dead end so close your eye and escape from what you hide how long will I take to bleed , there be no save me how far will you go to hold on I be good off cut my own throat , in hope for once that you might hear me I know I can at least count on the mess never judge me I be break out from all I have come to be alone I have go through hell and back to try to fall and there be no save me ... __________________ name no save Me Artist Walls of Jericho album redemption
