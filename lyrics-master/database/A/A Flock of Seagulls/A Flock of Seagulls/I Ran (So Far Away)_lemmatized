I walk along the avenue I never think I will meet a girl like you meet a girl like you with auburn hair and tawny eye the kind of eye that hypnotize me through you hypnotize me through and I run I run so far away I just run I run all night and day I could n't get away a cloud appear above your head a beam of light come shine down on you shine down on you the cloud be move near still Aurora Borealis come in view Aurora come in view and I run I run so far away I just run I run all night and day I could n't get away reach out a hand to touch your face you be slowly disappear from my view disappear from my view reach out a hand to try again I be float in a beam of light with you a beam of light with you and I run I run so far away I just run I run all night and day and I run I run so far away I just run I could n't get away _________________________ name I Ran ( so far away ) Artist A Flock of seagull album a Flock of seagull write by Alistair M . score , Francis Reynolds Maudsley , Michael Score , Paul Reynolds Copyright Universal Music Publishing Group
