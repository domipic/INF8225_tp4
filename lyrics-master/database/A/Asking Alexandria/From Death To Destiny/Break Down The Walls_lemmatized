close your eye and leave all your fear behind , it be alright close your eye and follow me until the end so if you be hopeless we can pick up the piece and if you be break I can carry the pain be you with me ? watch the flame rise high Sing this with me break down the wall , I want it all I wo n't stop until I burn this to the ground scream and shout ' til the light go out I wo n't stop until I burn this to the ground we wo n't take this , you ca n't break us we wo n't stop until the world be in our hand break down the wall , I want it all I wo n't stop until I burn this to the ground do n't let go , we carry our torch high , always burn we have come too far to throw it all away so be you with me ? watch the flame rise high Sing this with me break down the wall , I want it all I wo n't stop until I burn this to the ground scream and shout ' til the light go out I wo n't stop until I burn this to the ground we wo n't take this , you ca n't break us we wo n't stop until the world be in our hand break down the wall , I want it all I wo n't stop until I burn this to the ground I light the match and watch it fall to the ground as the ember rise and the smoke fill the air break down the wall , I want it all I wo n't stop until I burn this to the ground scream and shout ' til the light go out I wo n't stop until I burn this to the ground we wo n't take this , you ca n't break us we wo n't stop until the world be in our hand break down the wall , I want it all I wo n't stop until I burn this to the ground __________________________ name break down the Walls Artist ask Alexandria album from death to Destiny
