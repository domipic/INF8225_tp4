you love me for all the wrong reason there be nothing but pain leave here I know what be kill me be that I be kill you three year of torment and torturous love stain with tear and mistrust , enough be enough I ca n't hold you any longer in this hell I be in ' Cause your heart be too weak for me to break it again all the mistake that I have make you forgive , what the fuck ? you should n't have stay you will always say " there be so much love in you " I ca n't believe that you ca n't see that you love me for all the wrong reason I be not the same as I use to be there be nothing but pain leave here I know what be kill me be that I be kill you do you remember the beginning ? heartbeat one and the same ? living smite in Texas , burn bright as a flame so young and in love , no care what anyone say ' til my soul grow cold and my heart turn dead what go so wrong with me ? why do I break this ? why be I so blind and fuck dumb to see that we be perfect ' til I turn around and give in to debauchery this be your chance to escape this my goodbye with a last kiss ' Cause I know deep down you know that you love me for all the wrong reason I be not the same as I use to be there be nothing but pain leave here I know what be kill me be that I be kill you you love me for all the wrong reason I be not the same as I use to be there be nothing but pain leave here I know what be kill me be that I be kill you _________________ name kill you artist ask Alexandria album from death to Destiny
