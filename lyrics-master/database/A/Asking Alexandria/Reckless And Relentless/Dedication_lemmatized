you will never really find those perfect word something more than just ... " goodbye " it be hard to remember the good time when there be just so much heartache but they deserve more than that they deserve more than just one single moment of sadness so just remember that when there be enough love in our heart to burst like a fuck supernova and there sure as hell 's enough love in our heart to spark that famous smile we all lose someone at some point in our life but do n't ever let go of that smile hold on forever because that be our final dedication ________________ name dedication artist ask Alexandria album reckless and relentless
