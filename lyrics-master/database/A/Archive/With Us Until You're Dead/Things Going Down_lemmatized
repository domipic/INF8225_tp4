I do n't like your space I do n't like your hate when you direct your smile it just burn a hole in me when I feel you burn see you turn do n't turn your hate on me turn that hate on me do n't turn that hate on me break me free I be sure about thing go down do n't turn that hate on me do n't turn that hate on me do n't turn that hate on me _______________________ name thing go down Artist Archive album with us until you be Dead
