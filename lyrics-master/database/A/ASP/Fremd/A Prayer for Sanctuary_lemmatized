like the haunt chant and prayer to which I have never listen thou shall no longer live in chain or ever be imprison . ease my always throb heart , I shall no longer falter as pupa to imago all image must alter . let thy glory shine on me , disperse my obfuscation , hide thy essence in myself , I need assimilation . stream thyself into my soul and flood it with thy yearning , pour thy soul into my shell , erase my restless burning . I hear voice of a stranger . I hear voice of a stranger . I hear voice of a stranger . I hear voice in my head , echo . I hear voice of a stranger . I hear voice of a stranger . I hear voice of a stranger . I hear voice in my head , echo . ____________________________ name a Prayer for sanctuary artist asp album fremd
