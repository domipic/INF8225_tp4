while shutter enclose the boundary of my heart . I hold my breath till the steady beating be shut out . in silence I wait for what be real . for I know the truth of my perception . nothing in life matter more , more than you . nothing more , more than you . when first feeling fade , I will still be here . I hold my breath till the steady beating be shut out . for I know the truth of my perception . nothing in life matter more , more than you . nothing more , more than you . when first feeling fade , I will still be here . ________________________________ name the truth of my perception artist as I Lay die album shadow be Security
