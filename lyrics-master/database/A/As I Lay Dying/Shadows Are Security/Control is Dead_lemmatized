control be dead in this blind world , for we do what we hate . split from inside . betray by emotion . we must look past what be in front of us . shadow be security . they have become the solace of my look glass heart . in search for certainty , I no longer need control . take me through the fire , refine what be yours . it be time to overcome this . we must look past what be in front of us . _____________________ name Control be Dead Artist as I Lay die album shadow be Security
