the sound of silent voice survey my thought regularity define perfection neither sorrow nor contentment whispering emptiness . frail word collapse my weight only stir the ground how long can I hold your hand as you walk over grave ? you search for tear of compassion yet find the comfort of winter reassurance dead like the fall leaf lose hope in your unchanging way all of my strength can save you if you be unwilling to help yourself . ____________________________ name Falling upon Deaf ear Artist as I Lay die album frail word collapse
