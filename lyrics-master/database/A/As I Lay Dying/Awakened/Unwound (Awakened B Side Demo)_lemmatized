I see no reason to try and be what I be not if simple honesty move me , then why should I care ? other may think I lose my poetic way ( I have lose my way ) but I will rather make my point without confusion I have fail those who I love the most and in the process become aware I have accept there be so much that I do n't know I have accept my limitation it be that knowledge that open the door for great understanding Perspective on what be still untold I have accept there be so much that I do n't know I have accept my limitation I have accept there be so much that I will never know I have accept my limitation sort out my thought , that be why I write though I reveal my weakness surrender be remedy these song have help me though my great pain unwind within me the disorder of my life I now see thing for how they be even if that be a harsh reality I have accept there be so much that I do n't know I have accept my limitation I have accept there be so much that I will never know I have accept my limitation ____________________________________ name unwind ( awaken B Side Demo ) Artist as I Lay die album awaken
