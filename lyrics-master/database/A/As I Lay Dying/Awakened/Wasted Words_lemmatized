there be day when sorrow seem never-end like the countless road upon which I have drive the price of attachment in pursuit of dream that I so often ca n't seem to remember yet there be day when beauty can be contain it even crawl out from under ordinary thing a foreigner , no place to go hold on , make the most of what little time I have all the waste word I say in all the city that I leave the last act of our precious play must not close with regret I will not leave wish I have do thing differently the moment I treasure be seldom the one that I plan for and if I know where pain hide I might still let it go so when the audience have run toward the late drift it will be my time to face the life that I have set a foreigner in my own home hold on , no place to go all the waste word I say in all the city that I leave the last act of our precious play must not close with regret ( regret ) all the waste word some day the line between peace and pain seem more like a blur but I know with certainty I ca n't leave wish , I can leave I ca n't leave wish I have do thing differently all the waste word I say in all the city that I leave the last act of our precious play must not close with regret ( regret ) all the waste word __________________ name waste word Artist as I Lay die album awaken
