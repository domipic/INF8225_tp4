I could not in conscience hold on . as we face distress we must not lose heart . stand fast and press on , triumph await . as we face distress we must not lose heart . stand fast and press on , triumph await us . the powerful constant that I have once lean on be no longer there . ( no long ) you call this shameful disbelief , a process like lose my close friend . as we face distress we must not lose heart . stand fast and press on , triumph await . as we face distress we must not lose heart . stand fast and press on , triumph await us . sometimes we have to watch our whole life fall apart , before we can rebuild them again , a Greater Foundation . we watch our whole life . sometimes we have to watch our whole life ... fall apart , before we can rebuild them again , ( rebuild them again ) a Greater Foundation . I wish there be another way , but no amount of devotion can fix this . triumph await . triumph await . triumph await . triumph await . triumph await . sometimes we have to watch our whole life fall apart , before we can rebuild them again , a Greater Foundation . we watch our whole life . fall apart . sometimes we have to watch our whole life . rebuild them again . before we can rebuild them again , a Greater Foundation __________________________ name a Greater Foundation Artist as I Lay die album awaken
