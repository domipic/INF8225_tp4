like a swarm of fly collide with a move windshield so be our life on this never-end road I have leave behind my mark only to later be wash away and be consume with the allure despite the inevitable decay when do the road that I be on become my only home ? when do this become the one place I truly know ? ( I truly know ) a journey make us like weed where the wind steal our splendor but spread it to the distant field despite our fragile imperfection yet shake wall and wear wheel can never capture my heart the way you do when do the road that I be on become my only home ? ( my only home ) when do this become the one place I truly know ? I be miss what make me whole __________________ name my only Home Artist as I Lay die album awaken
