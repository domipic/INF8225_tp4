I can only imagine that wrath be be hold out so there will be time for us to be redeem but surely wrath be not be hold out so that we may redeem ourselves for I have see the madness of those who die try but be regret only a word that the living possess ? I long to see their face regardless of the decay for in the eye of the deceased ... we would see hope in our last day inside this die world for there be still beauty inside this die world for what good be there hold off wrath if we be determine to bring wrath upon ourselves __________________________ name wrath upon ourselves artist as I Lay die album an Ocean between U
