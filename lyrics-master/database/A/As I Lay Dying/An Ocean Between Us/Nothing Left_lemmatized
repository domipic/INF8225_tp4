yeah , yeah this world be never worthy but how can I call it unfaithful ? every promise be fulfill as decay crawl from its throat like the dead rising from an open grave like the dead rising from an open grave lip of splendor , tongue of deceit all die now as our fragile wrist hold only waste like those gasp for their last breath we can hide there be nothing leave like those gasp for their last breath we can hide there be nothing left nothing leave , nothing leave there be nothing left nothing leave if all my sorrow have lead me here then I would cry all of my tear to have this chance , to have this chance again to have this chance , to have this chance and know there be more than this and know there be more than you like those gasp for their last breath we can hide there be nothing leave like those gasp for their last breath we can hide there be nothing leave __________________ name nothing Left Artist as I Lay die album an Ocean between U
