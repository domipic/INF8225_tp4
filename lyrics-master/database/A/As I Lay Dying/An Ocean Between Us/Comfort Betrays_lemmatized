Rah ! you sit and watch as I nearly destroy myself never have I feel so betray that you would sacrifice my life for no more than your comfort . and now your love mean nothing , nothing to me , your love mean nothing to me . nothing to me . you be a coward the antithesis of a friend , take action before there be no one leave to defend . for I would have stand by you , for I would have stand by you , right to the gate of hell . for I would have stand by you , right to the gate of hell . right to the gate of hell . _____________________ name comfort betray artist as I Lay die album an Ocean between U
