I never want and I never care before . I never want and I never care before . take it back , this be a new day . I never want and I never care before . take it back , this be . how I long to regress to the day before I take upon myself : the obsession of this world : a day of innocence equating beauty : and tomorrow may fall : and today be already go tomorrow may fall today be already go . take it back , this be a new day . I never want , this be a new day . and I never care before . I never want , I never want , and I never care before . I have grow tired of chase convinced I be in need and now the year I have spend only a slave to this . tomorrow may fall and today be already go , I will no longer adore these thing that will never satisfy me . I have see my world change and then go back to where it come . in this vicious circle we be all bring back to life only to die . in this vicious circle we be all bring back to life only to die . to die . : in this vicious circle : we be all : bring back to life : only to die . : in this vicious circle : we be all : bring back to life : only to die . I have see my world change and then go back to where it come . ____________________ name I never want Artist as I Lay die album an Ocean between U
