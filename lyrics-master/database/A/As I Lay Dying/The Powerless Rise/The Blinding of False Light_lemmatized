I see now , I see that conformity be betrayal . with empty eye I have look ahead ( ahead ) , with clarity I now look back . now be our chance to breathe without tyranny , release from the blinding of false light . ( blind of false light ) . now be our chance ( our chance ) to breathe without , without tyranny . in weakness we be free . yeah ! I admit my failure . opacity have dull my sense . conformity ( conformity ) control by lifeless vice . oh ! yeah ! covetousness ( covetousness ) disguise as ambition . but now it end . but now it end . but now it end . but now it end . not with defeat but determination . we be free . yeah ! now be our chance to breathe without tyranny , release from the blinding of false ( false ) light ( light ) . now be our chance . now be our chance . in weakness we be free . _________________________________ name the blinding of false Light Artist as I Lay die album the powerless rise
