I still believe that there be hope for us , but I believe we must look outside the sanctuary of oppression that have bring our world so much pain ... . yeah ... . another blind guide replace divine eye ( eye ) . whitewash tomb ( whitewash tomb ) have hide the truth . reach out your hand to find forgiveness , only to be plague by disease ( plague by disease ) . reach out your hand to find forgiveness ( reach out your hand ) , only to be plague by disease . reach out your hand , reach out your hand . ________________ name the plague artist as I Lay die album the powerless rise
