what we see now be only a fraction ... bind to learn the hard way this be the human condition there be nothing that can be say to stop us from make mistake when I look to myself as a source of end pain no matter how many time before I have fail it seem our problem solve themselves when we look beyond us to those truly in hell the more I focus on myself then the more helpless that I become so why not erase this point of view ? my suffering be trivial ( beyond our suffering ) compare to those who know real agony it seem our problem solve themselves when we look beyond our suffering it seem our problem solve themselves when we look beyond our suffer my trial seem insignificant now why wo n't we look beyond us ? why wo n't we look beyond our despair ? it seem our problem solve themselves when we look to those truly in hell personal redemption can change the world unless we lie down our life for those who still suffer __________________________ name beyond our suffer artist as I Lay die album the powerless rise
