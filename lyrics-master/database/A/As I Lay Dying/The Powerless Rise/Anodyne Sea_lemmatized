none of this matter , none of these word . common and silent we will die in this world . we have only speak to those who agree , and without them we have fall on deaf ear . stand on conviction and you will walk alone . for once I have stand ( I have stand ) , no one will know , but alone I be bear and alone we must go . in my conviction I have find my own grave , but amongst the dead we all fade away . yeah ... yet solitude be good than a life not worthy of reaction . there be nothing to lose ( nothing ) . so we stand alone or join those who follow in misery . in my conviction I have find my own grave , but amongst the dead we all fade away . in my conviction I have find my own grave , but amongst the dead we all fade away . fade away ... stand on conviction and you will walk alone . a voice be only a noise without someone to hear , and without a crowd to feed that noise grow silent . for once I have stand , no one will know , but alone I be bear and alone we must go . fade back into an anodyne sea , to drown with all who have go before me . yeah ... we must go . in my conviction I have find my own grave ( my own grave ) , but amongst the dead we all fade away . yeah ... in my conviction ( conviction ) , I have find my own grave , but amongst the dead we all fade away . stand on conviction and you will walk alone . yeah ... fade back into an anodyne sea , to drown with all who have go before me . fade back ... fade . fade back into an anodyne sea . fade back ... fade . fade back ... fade away . _________________ name anodyne Sea Artist as I Lay die album the powerless rise
