I have try to find reconciliation behind the wall of those whose hatred burn . for I find it easy to reach someone who still feel , than to make amends with passionless apathy . where all line be the same a portrait can be make . I need to burn inside . I need to know that you be alive . I need to know that feeling of discontent be strong than indifference for those too weak to stand . like a colorless sky over a sea of nothingness , hatred face its enemy while apathy strike furtively . I need to burn inside . I need to know that you be alive . I need to know that feeling of discontent be strong than indifference for those too weak to stand . I need to know that feeling of discontent be strong than indifference for those too weak to stand ... until our anger burn against injustice , we will create the faceless by dismiss those force to concede . many of us have turn off the light outside , erase what exist beyond our front door . and for you I find it hard to reach common ground than my most glaring opposition . but what about those who have lose the luxury of choice ? ... strive for identity , bury by our lack of interest , soul mark as mere history . how much grievance will it take to awaken us ? I need to know that feeling of discontent be strong than indifference for those too weak to stand . I need to know that feeling of discontent be strong than indifference for those too weak to stand ... how much grievance will it take to awaken us from the comfort of our home ? ... the comfort of our oversized grave . I have try to find reconciliation ... I have try to find reconciliation ... ______________________ name Anger and apathy artist as I Lay die album the powerless rise
