the only constant be change . the only constant be change . go ... the human heart be bear without leg , slide back and forth , and never once do it truly rest , unless accompany by death ... slide back and forth . even the strong remnant of history , they have begin to crumble against time . slide back and forth . the only constant be change . nothing remain the same . the only constant be change . there be only growth or decay . yea ... let be go ... Unvarying scene only find in picture can never breathe life . for nowhere else do level ground exist , unless it have be capture by a flash of steady light . slide back and forth ( back and forth ) . the only constant be change . uncertainty await . the only constant be change . there be only growth or decay ... or decay . the only constant be change ... . there be nothing that stay the same , from the foundation of our life . there be nothing that stay the same . there be nothing to erase time ... . the only constant be change . nothing remain the same . the only constant be change . there be only growth or decay ... Yeaah ... the only constant be change ( change ) . the only constant be change . _________________________________ name the only Constant be Change Artist as I Lay die album the powerless rise
