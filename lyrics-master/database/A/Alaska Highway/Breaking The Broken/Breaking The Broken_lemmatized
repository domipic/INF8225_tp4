how could I have be so foolish ? how could I have be so blind ? what will it take for me to find the place where you be inside of my mind ? within and safe , protect by tear . hiding , a coward behind all of your fear . I may be see as perfect but I still feel pain . and all of your passion have be nothing but a mind distract game . just tell me what it be that I have do to be a victim of hope and hate by the sun . I find in all of this great misery , and nothing seem to make any sense to me . will this be a memory , will I have ever exist ? the word you speak , could I have resist ? keep all of your heart and then depart before the wing of an angel have be tear apart . I may be see as perfect but I still feel pain . and all of your passion have be nothing but a mind distract game . just tell me what it be that I have do to be a victim of hope and hate by the sun . I find in all of this great misery , and nothing seem to make any sense to me . I be more that what I have become , but be naive to have believe that you be the one to save me from this desperate state . how my love have turn so deeply into hate ? I may be see as perfect but I still feel pain . and all of your passion have be nothing but a mind distract game . just tell me what it be that I have do to be a victim of hope and hate by the sun . I find in all of this great misery , do any of this make sense to me ? _________________________ name break the Broken Artist Alaska Highway album break the Broken
