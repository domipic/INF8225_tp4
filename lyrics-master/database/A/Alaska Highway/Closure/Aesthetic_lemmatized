seek winter I have find , something cold in my heart . hope deplete as I pass , that which fall to pretend . never effort to offend , but to restrain these dream I be have . I can slip away right now , take these thought upon myself . and like the world , I may end for there be nothing to defend . press my face against the wall , Hide my eye so you ca n't see all the damage that you have do to me . pale rain that touch my face as I run towards a cruel illusion . hold this fragile thought in vain , tough that future will not save us . sleeping hell that wake for me . I can slip away right now , take these thought upon myself . and like the world , I may end for there be nothing to defend . press my face against the wall , Hide my eye so you ca n't see all the damage that you have do to me . all the damage that you have do to me . I can slip away right now , take these thought upon myself . and like the world , I may end for there be nothing to defend . press my face against the wall , Hide my eye so you ca n't see all the damage that you have do to me . I can slip away right now , take these thought upon myself . and like the world , I may end for there be nothing to defend . press my face against the wall , Hide my eye so you ca n't see all the damage that you have do to me . _______________ name aesthetic Artist Alaska Highway album closure
