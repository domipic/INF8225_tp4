why do you hide your eye from me ? there be no shame in empathy I be not perfect , there be no explanation . I have not come for complication . stake be make so that we learn , not stain that lead our soul to burn . why do you feel this way ? have I fail you , have I lead you astray ? have you invite darkness to your side ? no matter how you have try to hide , I see and love you as you be . why do you run from sadness ? it come from someplace good . if you have never truly love , then you have never truly hurt . doe that make make you feel weak ? and have I cross that line ? have I fail you , have I lead you astray ? have you invite darkness to your side ? no matter how you have try to hide , I see and love you as you be . do not hide your face from me , tear be a sign of God 's mercy . as you cry , so do he . I love you as you be ... ___________________ name as you be ... Artist Alaska Highway album closure
