here the building be high than the one you have know . and it be much dark on this side , see why my heart I have to hide . it be in this place I may be some prince , some king , some freak . but it mean nothing without your hand here in mine . but tonight I be go to the city to forget you . but tonight I be go to the city to forget you . how could I erase someone that mean so much to me ? though I may have let you go , inside my mind it be still not free . here I be strong . no emotion to bring me down . but what be it a heart if we do n't tear it apart in a masquerade of game we play ? the light above us , these tower we could never climb . you once be a star to lead me away from the pain within my own decay . but tonight I be go to the city to forget you . but tonight I be go to the city to forget you . how could I erase someone that mean so much to me ? though I may have let you go , inside my mind it be still not free . but tonight I be go to the city to forget you . but tonight I be go to the city to forget you but tonight I be go to the city to forget you . but tonight I be go to the city to forget you . how could I erase someone that mean so much to me ? though I may have let you go , inside my mind it be still not free . but tonight I be go to the city to forget you . to forget you . to forget you . to forget you . _____________ name skyline Artist Alaska Highway album closure
