you can break all that you please , spread through me like some disease . Retalliation come with time , retribution shall be mine . City of Angels , I have return , the bridge I have cross we now must burn . let them fall beneath your sky , by the blade I live and die . City of Angels , fight with me , defend your heart and dignity . featured star fall from the sky , by the blade I live and die . you be the lamb to a slaughter , filthy ash drown in water . Phoenix never to arise in this place where all hope die . City of Angels , I have return , the bridge I have cross we now must burn . let them fall beneath the sky , by the blade I live and die . City of Angels , fight with me , defend your heart and dignity . featured star fall from the sky , by the blade we live and die . City of Angels , I have return , the bridge I have cross we now must burn . let them fall beneath the sky , by the blade I live and die . City of Angels , fight with me , defend your heart and dignity . featured star fall from the sky , by the blade we live and die . _________________________________ name City of Angels ( hybrid Mix ) Artist Alaska Highway album closure
