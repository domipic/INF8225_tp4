( weep with me ) weep with me in the depth of my reality ( weep with me ) and reveal the pain that once be beauty . be it your intent to hurt me ? let me waste away , desert me ? be it your hope to break me ? let me perish , devastate me ? weep with me before I abandon thee ( weep with me ) and distract my view with image to erase you . ( weep with me ) weep with me in the depth of my reality ( weep with me ) and reveal the pain that once be beauty .
