the sound of your name upon my heart have leave a stain . and I know that we must say goodbye , but without you inside my heart may die . but I do n't want the perfect rose , the one you say that I deserve . all I know be that I love you . hold you when you cry , without you I would rather die . and I have do everything that I can do , but I just ca n't keep you . and I do n't want the perfect rose , the one you say that I deserve . all I know be that I love you . hold you when you cry , without you I would rather die . and I be not the perfect rose , the one I think that you deserve . all I know be that I love you ... I love you . ____________ name warmth Artist Alaska Highway album attitude of a difficult mind
