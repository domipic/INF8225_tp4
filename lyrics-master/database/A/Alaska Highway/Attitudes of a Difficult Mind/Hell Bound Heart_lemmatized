I want to see you chain upon the wall wanna see your flesh rip , tear as you fall what would you give to touch my skin ? what would I give to know what hide within ? inside your hell bound heart that tear me apart now here with me you will stay and with your mind game I will play where your suffering taste so sweet here you be nothing but the victim at my foot I want to keep you away from the peace the one that you deprive me before I have decease and what reason could you give for my death ? you be an angel killer , do n't waste your breath it be your hell bound heart that tear me apart now here with me you will stay and with your mind game I will play when your suffering taste so sweet you will be nothing but the victim at my foot it be your hell bound heart that tear me apart now here in hell I will stay and with my mind game they will play where my suffering taste so sweet here I be nothing but the victim at their foot ( Nothing , nothing , nothing , nothing ) ______________________ name hell Bound Heart Artist Alaska Highway album attitude of a difficult mind
