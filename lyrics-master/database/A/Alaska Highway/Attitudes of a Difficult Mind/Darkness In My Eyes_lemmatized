people never see the other side of darkness . there be no fear , the face of those you have hurt , they can even be see , but you will never forget the one ( who you meet ) in the dark . within this place I have sense no evil , only the absence of hurt that I have feel . death hold my heart and keep me imprison to shield me from another fall . without caution I move towards nothing and you have see me somehow . the imperfection in your mirror reflection of a beauty that die inside of me . darkness comfort me in this moment , I be slip into coma of complication , I want to embrace you , hold you . the mind be plague with the morbid hesitation . just tell me you be suffer and I will give you everything though I have nothing , but the darkness in my eye . the darkness in your eye ... you find me in this , I find you a rise ... of death . do I want you , could you want me ? accept my bouquet of decay . be I an image that comfort your fantasy or will this surface turn my dark reality ? be you the one , be I the one ? the wraith have leave me . and sun will kill us , suddenly kill us . darkness comfort me in this moment , I be slip into coma of complication , I want to embrace you , hold you . the mind be plague with the morbid hesitation . just tell me you be suffer and I will give you everything though I have nothing , but the darkness in my eye . the darkness in your eye ... follow the rose down into the depth and you will see what have bring you here . the wound of the heart , the depletion of faith , and the darkness inside your eye , darkness inside my eye , darkness inside your eye . inside my eye ... _________________________ name darkness in my eye Artist Alaska Highway album attitude of a difficult mind
