guess thing do n't go the way that you plan I miss the day when you would understand the way that I be you have me feel lonely and detach every time I be move forward we take two step back I need to have a moment to myself County line , clear my mind with someplace else besides this stairwell alone and on the road , I be overwhelmed I need to find the difference in how I feel and how I feel leave all the light on and maybe I will find my way back home leave all the light on I take this drive to be alone leave all the light on I wish I could get back to the way thing be when we be young , have fun , so self assure but now that be all a blur I miss the way we always use to talk now we talk ourselves in circle till we forget why we fight leave all the light on and maybe I will find my way back home leave all the light on I take this drive to be alone leave all the light on if I be not worth let go leave all the light on if you still care I need to know leave all the light on this get me so down down down why ca n't we work it out , ca n't we work it out ? this make me so down down down I have be try to see , if you be mean for me you get me so down down down , I be gonna turn this car around just know that it be the last time Ya it be the last time . leave all the light on and maybe I will find my way back home leave all the light on I take this drive to be alone ( Down , down , down ) leave all the light on , if I be not worth let go leave all the light on , if you still care I need to know ( Down , down , down ) leave all the light on Guess thing do n't go the way that you plan _____________________________ name leave all the light on Artist A Day to remember album common courtesy
