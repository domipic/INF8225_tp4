you be all about you , and it be my fast track to an early grave . just need to see this through do you even sleep at night ? where do your conscience run to hide ? I gotta get out , I gotta get out . why ca n't you just do what be right by me ? I gotta get out , I gotta get out . it ca n't get much hard , hard to breathe . the room keep spin faster , I be drift off to sleep . hope it be see beyond these wall you be suffocate me . why ca n't you see what three little word have do to me ? I never know I be alone , you turn your back , you break this home . take me so long to find the answer , and your reason why . I just want thing to be alright , or at least for just tonight . how be live a lie ? you never could face me , and you hide behind fake personality because deep down you be scare . so weak beyond compare . I gotta get out , I gotta get out . why ca n't we just go our separate way ? I gotta get out , I gotta get out . it wo n't be much farther , I be count the day . the room keep spin faster , I be drift off to sleep . hope it be see beyond these wall , you be suffocate me . why ca n't you see what three little word have do to me ? I never know I be alone , you turn your back , you break this home . take me so long to find the answer , and your reason why . I just want thing to be alright , or at least for just tonight . my friend still stand behind me . we stick together through all we lose . even when your bad surround me , you will never get the good of us . why ca n't you see what three little word have do to me ? I never know I be alone , you turn your back , you break this home . take me so long to find the answer , and your reason why . I just want thing to be alright , or at least for just tonight no fuck respect . all hail the thief forever try to separate you and me . all hail the thief forever try to separate no fuck respect . ____________________________________ name the Document Speaks for itself Artist A Day to remember album common courtesy
