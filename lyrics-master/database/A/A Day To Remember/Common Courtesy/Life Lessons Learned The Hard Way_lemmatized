life lesson learn the hard way . four people wait in a random white unmarked van . park outside your hotel high rise garage . to use a tire iron to break the bone inside your leg . too bad you never come outside , that be all right , ' Cause in the end you will get wreck . yeah , in the end , you will get wreck . I hear a little girl kill herself today , that blood be on your hand . it be on your hand , when everyone know your face , nothing be safe . you will live your life as a fuck target . you have earn my disgust . you have earn my disgust . _______________________________________ name life lesson Learned The Hard Way Artist A Day to remember album common courtesy
