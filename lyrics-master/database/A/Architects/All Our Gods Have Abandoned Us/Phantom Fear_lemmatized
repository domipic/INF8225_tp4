contaminated , nothing be sacred bear and breed on pure hatred ' Cause they haunt our street with a phantom fear no one be safe , no one be welcome here no one be welcome here can you taste the poison in the air ? I swear it be everywhere , it be everywhere Hidden in plain sight , lose in black and white I will chase the die of the light they want the victim to hang their head in shame well fuck them all , we wo n't play their game we wo n't play their game I have see through every word the prophet propagate this be a failed state so read between the line this be a failed state no love , no empathy our fellow man be now our enemy no love , no unity erase our soul , distort reality can you taste the poison in the air ? I swear it be everywhere , it be everywhere Hidden in plain sight , lose in black and white I will chase the die of the light they will sow the seed of blind contempt then let us bleed until our heart 's content Hidden in plain sight , lose in black and white I will chase the die of the light no love , no empathy our fellow man be now our enemy no love , no empathy no love , no unity our fellow man be now our enemy __________________ name phantom fear artist architect album all our God have abandon us
