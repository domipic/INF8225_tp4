every moment be dead to me do you remember ? because I ca n't forget the sad story of all that ever be or will be , lay out before me a live heart attack , play it back , play it back take my eye , I can see sense past and future tense , every moment be dead to me Safe and sound , anywhere but here I see it crystal clear but it mean nothing to me it mean nothing to me it mean nothing to me have you see a future fill with regret ? breathe and count to ten , start over again you want to run away , just let yourself decay a live heart attack , play it back , play it back the empty hourglass , we be go nowhere fast there be no more time to kill if time be stand still take my eye , I can see sense past and future tense , every moment be dead to me Safe and sound , anywhere but here I see it crystal clear but it mean nothing to me it mean nothing to me it mean nothing to me play it back , play it back over and over again over and over again the empty hourglass , we be go nowhere fast there be no more time to kill if time be stand still _________________________ name the empty hourglass artist architect album all our God have abandon us
