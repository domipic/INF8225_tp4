you be the shadow to my light do you feel us ? another star you fade away afraid our aim be out of sight wanna see us alight where be you now ? where be you now ? where be you now ? be it all in my fantasy ? where be you now ? be you only imaginary ? where be you now ? Atlantis under the sea under the sea where be you now ? another dream the monster 's run wild inside of me I be fade I be fade so lose , I be fade I be fade so lose , I be fade these shallow water never meet what I need I be let go a deep dive eternal silence of the sea . I be breathe alive where be you now ? where be you now ? under the bright but fade light you have set my heart on fire where be you now ? where be you now ? where be you now ? Atlantis under the sea under the sea where be you now ? another dream the monster 's run wild inside of me I be fade I be fade so lose , I be fade I be fade so lose , I be fade ___________ name fade Artist Alan Walker album fade
