loneliness , it shadow me quick than darkness crawl to the surface of my skin visibly surround by it Black be all I feel so this be how it feel to be free ? surround by empty soul artificial courage use and because so , once be mine I walk this maze alone Black be all I feel so this be how it feel to be free ? man be beside himself man be below himself man be behind himself be I inside myself ? chaos and hate shadow me Pain , it fill me up only one thing make me feel miss good half of me Black be all I feel so this be how it feel to be free ? man be beside himself man be below himself man be behind himself be I inside myself ? _________________ name be I inside album sap Artist Alice in chain write by Layne Staley
