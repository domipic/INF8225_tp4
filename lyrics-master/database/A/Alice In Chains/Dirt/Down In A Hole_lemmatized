Whoo-hoo-hoo ... bury me softly in this womb I give this part of me for you sand rain down and here I sit hold rare flower in a tomb ... ( in bloom ) down in a hole and I do n't know if I can be save see my heart I decorate it like a grave oh , you do n't understand who they think I be suppose to be look at me now I be a man who wo n't let himself be down in a hole , feel so small down in a hole , lose my soul I will like to fly , but my wing have be so deny down in a hole and they have put all the stone in their place I have eat the sun so my tongue have be burn of the taste I have be guilty of kick myself in the tooth I will speak no more of my feeling beneath Down in a hole , feel so small down in a hole , lose my soul I will like to fly , but my wing have be so deny ( Bury me softly in this womb ) oh I want to be inside of you ( I give this part of me for you ) oh I want to be inside of you ( sand rain down and here I sit ) ( Holding rare flower ) oh I want to be inside of you in a tomb ... ( in bloom ) oh I want to be inside ... down in a hole , feel so small down in a hole , lose my soul down in a hole , feel so small down in a hole , lose my soul I will like to fly , but my wing have be so deny ____________________ name down in a Hole Artist Alice in chain album dirt Year @card@
