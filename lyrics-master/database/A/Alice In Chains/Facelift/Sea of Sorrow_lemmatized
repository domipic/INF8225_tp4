mind of destructive taste I choose to stroll amongst the waste that be your heart lose in the dark call off the chase Walls of thought , strong and high as my castle crumble with time I think of you , oh yes I do such a crime you open fire , and your mark be true you open fire , aim my smile skull at you you open fire I live tomorrow , you I will not follow as you wallow in a sea of sorrow line cut across my face why you laugh at my disgrace ? I will never know how far to go to reach that place you open fire , and your mark be true you open fire , aim my smile skull at you you open fire I live tomorrow , you I will not follow as you wallow in a sea of sorrow you open fire , and your mark be true you open fire , aim my smile skull at you you open fire I live tomorrow , you I will not follow as you wallow in a sea of sorrow I live tomorrow , you I will not follow as you wallow in a sea of sorrow I live tomorrow , you I will not follow as you wallow in a sea of sorrow I live tomorrow , you I will not follow as you wallow in a sea of sorrow ________________ name Sea of Sorrow Artist Alice in chain album facelift Year @card@
