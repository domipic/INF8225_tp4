we be the ghost of the midway the beast of the alley we be the live dead live in your nightmare scrape ourselves from the earth live as though we be dirt Staring like you have see a ghost the low of the low with nowhere to go back from the dead , now we be grovel at your foot handcuff for lie our head as we be wither in the street back from the dead , now we be grovel at your foot handcuff for lie our head as we be wither in the street fighting for your attention , beg for your generosity look up just to see you turn your cheek on me you walk on by like I be invisible , invisible All I want be to be see as an equal we fight your battle and we build your home sorry if I disturb you , I just wish we could live like you do even in our most beautiful day it be dark just look at the world around you there be a consequence for what we do Pass judgment on me as you walk picture perfect ai n't my obsession you ca n't sum up my life from a first impression Learn your lesson act like you know me but do you even know yourself ? when you get nothin ' , you get nothin ' to lose Act like you know me but do you even know yourself ? when you get nothin ' , you get nothin ' to lose I may have no one else to blame ( but listen to me ) you and I , we be once the same ( the same ) I may have no one else to blame ( but listen to me ) you and I , we be once the same ( the same ) I may have no one else to blame ( but listen to me ) you and I , we be once the same ( the same ) I may have no one else to blame ( but listen to me ) you and I , we be once the same ( the same ) ____________ name ghost Artist August Burns Red album find in Far away place
