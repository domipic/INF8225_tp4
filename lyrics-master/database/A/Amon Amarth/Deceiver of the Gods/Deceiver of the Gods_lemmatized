since I be bear , they have keep me down , they have force me to conform . I will tear down the holy crown in a vengeful thunderstorm , I loathe their bloody righteous way it fill me with despise , fuel flame of violent rage , I will be their world 's demise . Asgard have always be my home but I be of different blood I will overthrow their throne deceiver , deceiver of the god all this rage , and all this hate , it burn me deep inside , and still it be , the only thing , keep me alive . dark ambition within my heart and it be ache to break free the one true nature of my soul , the giant live in me . kneel ! you all shall kneel to me ! or death will set you free ! you all shall kneel to me ! fall ! you all shall fall to me ! vengeance will be sweet ! you all shall fall to me ! Asgard have always be my home but I be of different blood I will overthrow their throne deceiver of the god Asgard have always be my home I be of a different blood I have come to overthrow their throne deceiver , deceiver of the god ! __________________________ name deceiver of the God Artist Amon Amarth album deceiver of the God
