Racing ' cross the arctic land a mount legion under my command we be a brutal force no man can withstand total havoc be at hand see the black crow circle high waiting for brave man to die they sense the come of the tide when opposition be sweep aside the fateful message reach us month ago that our home be under siege and since that day we have be head north our kinsman need our relief as we near our fortress wall Black smoke be rise to the sky Burnt black ruin of our father 's hall and corpse greet our tired eye what madness lead them to attack Victory could not be win they must have know there be no turn back and now they all be go no woman , child or man be spare their body lie where they fall suffering , anguish and despair as they go through live hell so now we be on the ride again and vengeance be our newfound path we draw our strength from grief and pain these bastard shall know our endless wrath see the black crow circle high waiting for brave man to die they sense the come of the tide when opposition be sweep aside ________________________ name come of the Tide Artist Amon Amarth album deceiver of the God
