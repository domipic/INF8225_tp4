a startling sense of dislocation push away by voodoo crap spill your poison somewhere else can n't shake the needle from your back gun and chain , emotional drain Cutting it down to size capture by the Hindu curse that hold your mesmerize Slice my throat with stiletto knife to keep my burning hope alive the long black hair that smell like incense Turns to viper in my mind foul the pyramid with your presence hold in your tiny claw the snake that feed the witch with venom too late , no time to withdraw mambo witch mambo witch sound of torture and moral exhaustion barely conceal by telephone wire Heal the wound , and lick the scar , screw your eye to read those star she be fire , I be ice , Bound to burn at any price mambo witch mambo witch I want to kill you mambo witch mambo witch mambo witch mambo witch _________________ name mambo witch artist a split-second album ... from the Inside
