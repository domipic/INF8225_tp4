till my own grave to keep me level jam another dragon down the hole dig to the rhythm and the echo of a solitary siren one that push me along and leave me so desperate and ravenous I be so weak and powerless over you someone feed the monkey while I dig in search of China White as Dracula as I approach the bottom desperate and ravenous so weak and powerless over you little angel , go away come again some other day the devil have my ear today I will never hear a word you say he promise I would find a little solace and some peace of mind whatever , just as long as I do n't feel so desperate and ravenous I be so weak and powerless desperate and ravenous so weak and powerless over you over you ________________________ name weak and powerless Artist A Perfect Circle album thirteenth step write by Billy Howerdel , Maynard Keenan Copyright Sony / ATV Music Publishing LLC
