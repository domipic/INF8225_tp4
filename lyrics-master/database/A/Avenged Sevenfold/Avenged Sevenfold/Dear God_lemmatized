a lonely road , cross another cold state line Miles away from those I love , purpose hard to find while I recall all the word you speak to me can n't help but wish that I be there back where I will love to be , oh yeah Dear God the only thing I ask of you be to hold her when I be not around when I be much too far away we all need that person who can be true to you but I leave her when I find her and now I wish I will stay ' Cause I be lonely and I be tired I be miss you again oh no once again there be nothing here for me on this barren road there be no one here while the city sleep and all the shop be close can n't help but think of the time I have have with you Pictures and some memory will have to help me through Oh yeah Dear God the only thing I ask of you be to hold her when I be not around when I be much too far away we all need that person who can be true to you I leave her when I find her and now I wish I will stay ' Cause I be lonely and I be tired I be miss you again oh no once again some search , never find a way before long , they waste away I find you , something tell me to stay I give in , to selfish way and how I miss someone to hold when hope begin to fade . a lonely road , cross another cold state line Miles away from those I love , purpose hard to find Dear God the only thing I ask of you be to hold her when I be not around when I be much too far away we all need that person who can be true to you I leave her when I find her and now I wish I will stay ' Cause I be lonely and I be tired I be miss you again oh no once again -Solos- ______________ name Dear God Artist avenge sevenfold album avenge sevenfold
