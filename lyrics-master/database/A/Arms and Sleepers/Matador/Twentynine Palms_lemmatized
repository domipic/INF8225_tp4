I want on my body a legion of your army to spread a canvas on me , to bury you upon me . you come without a warning . a message on my body . a blessing on my body . I see it on your body ; in pink , in porcelain , Ivory . the thread , a canvas awning . I carry you upon me . you come without a warning . a message on my body . a blessing on my body . ______________________ name Twentynine Palms Artist Arms and sleeper album matador
