' cause in the heat of bliss , we swear we would never love another there be truth and dignity in that oath can there be any hope for their retention , in its breaking ? that even while be disavow , we recognize humanity we have all make mistake , and G-d , I have make mistake but my mistake have n't make me oh fall acorn , lose and alone can you still be kiss by fire , give up your seed and spring up into a towering , mighty oak ? we have be lead into the wilderness by some radiant lover , just to be leave in the cold a distant memory , the warmth of home ' Cause in the heat of bliss , we swear we would never love another we have all make mistake , every last one of us and just because we have tell a lie , can we not still grow to be honest ? oh fall acorn , lose and alone can you still be kiss by fire , give up your seed and spring up into a towering , mighty oak ? throw off kilter none of us would have think we will be who we be now when we be still little eye wide to possibility who could have know that we will witness such depravity ____________________________ name the poet cry for more artist be as an Ocean album how we both wondrously Perish
