I have see you in my sleep ! we be laugh , cry , joke you know , the way it use to be back when we young and all that much more free I just hope you see that nothing be change between you and me no matter the time we have spend apart I know it be not always easy to show it but please believe that I carry you in my heart that you be with me through every mile I could have swear I see your phantom standing in the aisle ! " it seem you already know what I be think and that , even after all this time some thing still do go without say we savor the taste of our sweet youth and now , with callous hand , gather the remain fruit to go any farther , we must endure further pain skin , mash , and finally strain ferment in the time spend away only to return with a fine vintage to cheer to the health of those who stay ____________________________________ name even the Dead have their task artist be as an Ocean album how we both wondrously Perish
