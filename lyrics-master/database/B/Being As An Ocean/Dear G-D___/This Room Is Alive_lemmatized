this room 's alive breathing in this moment , each one of us be leave all of life 's worry and trouble far behind speak in tongue sweat blood rapture some people search their entire life for such a cure scream silently inside past horror plague their mind this be our release this be our violent plea heart scar and bandage soul weather and damage this be our release our violent plea it be time to burn the past take off our self-fabricated cope mask we will let each other see who we really be with our break limb and battle scar naked , all thing strip away you will see we have all go through similar pain and like child , we count and play our hiding game but we wo n't come inside when Grace call our name slave to our guilt and shame point the finger at the one who be never really to blame ourselves reopen your wound anew and watch the break come to stand by you you do n't have to feel alone Cause I know this place could feel like home there be no need to run and hide when your true family be stand by your side ________________________ name this Room be alive artist be as an Ocean album Dear G-D ...
