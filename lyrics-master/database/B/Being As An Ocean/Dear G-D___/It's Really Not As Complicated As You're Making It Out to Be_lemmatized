I do dimly perceive that while everything around me be ever-changing , ever-dying there be , underlie all that change , a living power that be changeless , that hold all together , that create , dissolve , and recreate . that inform power or spirit be God , and since nothing else that I see merely through the sense can or will persist , he alone be . and be this power benevolent or malevolent ? I see it as purely benevolent . for I can see , that in the midst of death , Life persist , in the midst of untruth , truth persist , in the midst of darkness , Light persist . hence I gather , that God be Life , truth , Light , he be love . he be the supreme good . but he be no god who merely satisfy the intellect , if he ever do . God to be God must rule the heart and transform it . he must express himself in every small act of his votary . it be prove not by extraneous evidence , but in the transform conduct and character of those who have feel the real presence of God within . to reject this evidence be to deny oneself . this realization be precede by an immovable faith . he who would , in his own person , test the fact of God 's presence can do so by a live faith , and since faith itself can be prove by extraneous evidence , the safe course be to believe in ... ; the law of truth and love . exercise of faith will be the safe where there be a clear determination summarily to reject all that be contrary to truth and love . I confess that I have no argument to convince through reason , faith transcend reason . all that I can advise be not to attempt the impossible . __________________________________________________________________ name it be really not as complicated as you be make it out to be artist be as an Ocean album Dear G-D ...
