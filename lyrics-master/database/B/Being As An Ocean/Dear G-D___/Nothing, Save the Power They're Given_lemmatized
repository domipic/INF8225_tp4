these word might mean nothing but it be a chance I be willing to take Cause maybe I be wrong and life can change I be sing out of my insecurity so someone , somewhere might be impact by what I have make I fidget and sway back and forth bite my nail down until they bleed there be a lie that I have believe I will tell you , but I be so scare of what you will think so I apologize if I have cause you to wake just close your eye and let the beat rock you back to sleep I will tell you in the morning about how this man you see often times feel like a child self-conscious and weak I will still put pen to paper try to explain these thing that invade my thought in my wake hour Stories of Kings and prince that have lose their way God , we will give anything just to feel safe deep down , we all know our worth we just need someone to truly love us first so we tip toe around these crowded room hope someone in attendance might be able to dress our wound we cry without utter a single word so gather close , circle round Cause maybe you have just never hear and I will tell you the story of the love I have find about the truth embed in you long before your birth I will ask once more what be these word worth ? ___________________________________________ name nothing , save the power they be give artist be as an Ocean album Dear G-D ...
