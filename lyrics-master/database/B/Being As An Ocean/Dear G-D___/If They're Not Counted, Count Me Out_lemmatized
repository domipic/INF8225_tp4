there be such hope in the story we have be tell recount endless time by the aging and old Tales of peace , worship and holy place palace adorn with gold and lofty terrace but I be always leave with quiet dismay Cause I be tell that some of those I love wo n't be with me so I be leave behind in an eternal place Cause the one who mean the most do n't receive your grace they call it beautiful , but to me it hold nothing that be holy I can only know what I have see and what I have see be that you have make us clean give us the right to be anything we want to be why would you give me eye to see and then deny me these ? eternity be a lock find inside our heart and you have hand humanity the key so I wo n't be sway by fantasy of unquenchable flame or some place of torment , the damned never to see your face we be all your creation you love us all the same A Father do n't sit idly by while his child be maim I have see true grace I promise you we will never feel the lick of those flame where death be your glory ? where Death be your sting ? for we be all child of the King every last one an eternal be so I will reject your fear and hatred for I bring good news that will be for all nation ! I have see wholeness in the break I have see health in the sick why do we stifle the Word you have speak ? if it kill me , I will tear these wall down brick by brick I have see hospitality in the homeless I have see light in the darkness and I have see hope in the damned so if all that have mean the most to me be n't present after my last breath Count me with the fall sheep and send me to the depth __________________________________________ name if they be not count , Count Me out Artist be as an Ocean album Dear G-D ...
