raise your glass high and share with me in my joy and grievings I toast to the mountain and valley to the future and the day go by I invite you in with good humor and levity all I have be yours and I pray that you drink deeply my cup have be empty so I may see what it taste like to be free Cause for so long this glass have own me focus on the chalice rather than what it contain so I give all of worth to the needy and the rest to the sea then I look around at all of the beautiful thing that I have gain what can a glass speak of its content and can it boast at its filling ? what else could it do but mutter a quiet thanks so it be that I look forward to my spillings for I be sure that such time be the only thing steady my hand from their violent shake so with gladness in my heart and hope in my eye I drink to my fill of your celebration wine and as I pour glass after glass I will lift it high ( I will lift you high ) and give a hearty toast to life ___________________ name salute E Vita Artist be as an Ocean album Dear G-D ...
