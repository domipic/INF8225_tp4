I be raise in the valley there be shadow and death get out alive but with scar I ca n't forget this kid back at school subdue and shy an orphan and a brother and unseen by most eye . I do n't know what it be that make a piece of him die take a boy to the forest , slaughter him with a scythe . stamp on his face , an impression in the dirt . do you think the silence make a good man convert ? we all have our horror and our demon to fight . but how can I win , when I be paralyze ? they crawl up on my bed , wrap their finger round my throat . be this what I get for the choice that I make ? God forgive me for all my sin God forgive me for everything God forgive me for all my sin God forgive me God forgive me do n't go I ca n't do this on my own do n't go no I ca n't do this on my own Save me from the one that haunt me in the night . I ca n't live with myself , so stay with me tonight . do n't go do n't go if I let you in you will just want out if I tell you the truth you will vie for a lie if I spill my gut it would make a mess we ca n't clean up . if you follow me you will only get lose . if you try to get closer we will only lose touch but you already know too much and you be not go anywhere tell me that you need me cause I love you so much tell me that you love me cause I need you so much tell me that you need me cause I love you so much say you will never leave me cause I need you so much do n't go I ca n't do this on my own do n't go no I ca n't do this on my own Save me from the one that haunt me in the night . I get scared so stay with me tonight do n't go I ca n't do this on my own do n't go save me from the bad and hold me in the night . save me from the one that haunt me in the night . do n't go do n't go do n't go do n't go do n't go do n't go do n't go do n't go do n't go do n't go do n't go do n't go _____________________________ name do n't go ( feat .
