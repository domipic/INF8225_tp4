eye like a car crash I know I should n't look but I ca n't turn away body like a whiplash Salt my wound but I ca n't heal the way I feel about you I watch you like a hawk I watch you like I be gonna tear you limb from limb will the hunger ever stop ? can we simply starve this sin ? that little kiss you steal ; it hold my heart and soul and like a deer in the headlight , I meet my fate do n't try to fight the storm ; you will tumble overboard tide will bring me back to you and on my deathbed , all I will see be you the life may leave my lung but my heart will stay with you that little kiss you steal ; it hold my heart and soul and like a ghost in the silence , I disappear do n't try to fight the storm ; you will tumble overboard tide will bring me back to you ( the wave will pull us under ) tide will bring me back to you ( the wave will pull us under ) tide will bring me back to you ( the wave will pull us under ) tide will bring me back to you tide will bring me back to you that little kiss you steal ; it hold my heart and soul and like a ghost in the silence , I disappear do n't try to fight the storm ; you will tumble overboard tide will bring me back to you that little kiss you steal ; it hold my heart and soul and like a deer in the headlight , I meet my fate do n't try to fight the storm ; you will tumble overboard tide will bring me back to you _______________ name deathbed Artist Bring Me the horizon album sempiternal
