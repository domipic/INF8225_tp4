take a photograph , it will be the last not a dollar or a crowd could ever keep me here I do n't have a past , I just have a chance not a family or honest plea remain to say Rain , rain , go away come again another day all the world be wait for the sun be it you I want or just the notion of a heart to wrap around so I can find my way around ? safe to say from here , you be get closer now we be never sad , ' cause we be not allow to be Rain , rain , go away come again another day all the world be wait for the sun Rain , rain , go away come again another day all the world be wait for the sun to lie here , under you , be all that I could ever do to lie here , under you , be all to lie here , under you , be all that I could ever do to lie here , under you , be all Rain , rain , go away come again another day all the world be wait for the sun Rain , rain , go away come again another day all the world be wait for the sun all the world be wait for the sun all the world be wait for the sun _________________ name Rain ( @card@ ) artist break Benjamin album we be not alone
