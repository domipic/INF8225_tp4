lie beneath , fade and selfish I fall between jaded and helpless I long to breathe , waste and empty inside defeat , faceless and bury alone into your eye I live beautifully break fight ! we will fight ! and bury our life we will break these chain and wash it away Oh light Carry me over the ground Heavy wo n't hold me down blind , belief , waste in envy I long to bleed , nameless and hate I fall relieved , violent and empty alive , deceit , suffer in silence alone into your eye I live beautifully break fight ! we will fight ! and bury our life we will break these chain and wash it away Oh light Carry me over the ground Heavy wo n't hold me down lose , warm , light ! tell me it be over , so long frail , dead , blind ! under the shadow , hold on fight , we will fight and bury our life we will break these chain and wash it away Carry me over the ground Heavy wo n't hold me down into the sun we burn Heavy wo n't hold me down ! down ! down ! down ! __________ name down artist break Benjamin album ember
