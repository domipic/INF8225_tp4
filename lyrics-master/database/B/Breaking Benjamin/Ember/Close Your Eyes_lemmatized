let forever take me in now I know that I be alive give me something to forgive as the wicked come to life show me where it all begin as I watch this world divide Hope will guide you to the end and there will be no last goodbye for all who live and die , leave it all behind take away the dark inside , and lead me to the light All will fade before your eye , as we turn the tide I will bring the dream to life , hold on , just hold on I will keep you here inside , just close your eye take the rebel from within now I know that I will survive show me how the lame pretend as I watch this world collide Fate will guide you to the end and there will be no hope to hide for all who live and die , leave it all behind take away the dark inside , and lead me to the light All will fade before your eye , as we turn the tide I will bring the dream to life , hold on , just hold on I will keep you here inside , just close your eye leave it all behind take away the dark inside , and lead me to the light All will fade before your eye , as we turn the tide I will bring the dream to life , hold on , just hold on I will keep you here inside , hold on , just hold on I will keep you here inside , just close your eye _____________________ name close your eye artist break Benjamin album ember
