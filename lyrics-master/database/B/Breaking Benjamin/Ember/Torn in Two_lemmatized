be this the way it be gotta be ? ignite the fire inside of me embrace the life of tragedy a tide of war and break dream I be tear in two ... hold on , hold on , we be barely alive I be fade through ... hold on , hold on , the fall arise I will fight this world for you and let the dawn of love survive broken , I crawl back to life be this the fate we fall between ? deface the life inside of me Drain the heart with atrophy and take away the remedy I be tear in two ... hold on , hold on , we be barely alive I be fade through ... hold on , hold on , the fall arise I will fight this world for you and let the dawn of love survive broken , I crawl back to life ! ( please hold on ... ) I be tear in two ... hold on , hold on , we be barely alive I be fade through ... hold on , hold on , the fall arise I will fight this world for you and let the dawn of love survive broken , I crawl back to life hold on rise ! hold on rise ! hold on rise ! hold on _________________ name Torn in two artist break Benjamin album ember
