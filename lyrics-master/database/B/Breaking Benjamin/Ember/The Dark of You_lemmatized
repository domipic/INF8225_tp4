it must have be inside my head I have lose the hope that I have leave and now , at last , it come to pass we sleep , we dream , we have no less along the path we lose our way it be all a game that I must play and now the weak that fall return to ash , defeat after all fade away to the wicked world we leave and I become the dark of you say a prayer for the wounded heart within as I become the dark of you let go , when all have come to life we live , we breathe , we die they call me to the light forever lose in time with every dream we find we feed , we burn , we lie the fall of humankind the everlasting light fade away to the wicked world we leave and I become the dark of you say a prayer for the wounded heart within as I become the dark of you let go , when all have come to life we live , we breathe , we die they call me to the light forever lose in time with every dream we find we feed , we burn , we lie the fall of humankind the everlasting light fade away to the wicked world we leave and I become the dark of you say a prayer for the wounded heart within as I become the dark of you ( let go ) save this selfish world save this selfish world save this selfish world save this selfish world _____________________ name the dark of you artist break Benjamin album ember
