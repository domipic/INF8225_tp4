take this blood ! I will make you I will starve the pain within I will crave you I will learn to hate again I will drain you I will make you whole again I will blame you I will lay beside the dead Cause I do n't want to live inside this hell tame the fire from within you wo n't break me love will tie the tourniquet and suffocate me I wo n't save you I wo n't starve the hope within I wo n't change you I wo n't fight the pain within I wo n't fail you I wo n't let your light descend I wo n't play you I wo n't face your fate again Cause I be bear to live inside this hell tame the fire from within you wo n't break me love will tie the tourniquet and suffocate me tame the fire from within you wo n't take me love will tie the tourniquet and suffocate me let the calm rise up so graceful every waste word so faithful tame the fire from within you wo n't break me love will tie the tourniquet and suffocate me tame the fire from within you wo n't take me love will tie the tourniquet and suffocate me suffocate me suffocate me ________________ name tourniquet artist break Benjamin album ember
