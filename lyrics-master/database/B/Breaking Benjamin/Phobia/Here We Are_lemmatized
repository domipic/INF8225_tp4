sing it for me I ca n't erase the stupid thing I say you be good than me I struggle just to find a good way so here we be fighting and try to hide the scar I will be home tonight take a breath and softly say goodbye the lonely road the one that I should try to walk alone I will be home tonight take a breath and softly say goodbye you would n't like me keep move on until forever end do n't try to fight me the beauty queen have lose her crown again so here we be fighting and try to hide the scar I will be home tonight take a breath and softly say goodbye the lonely road the one that I should try to walk alone I will be home tonight take a breath and softly say goodbye goodbye so why be you so eager to betray ? pick the piece up , pick the piece up so why be you the one that run away ? pick the piece up , pick the piece up so here we be fighting and try to hide the scar I will be home tonight take a breath and softly say goodbye the lonely road the one that I should try to walk alone I will be home tonight take a breath and softly say goodbye _________________ name here we be artist break Benjamin album phobia
