here I stand , helpless and leave for dead close your eye , so many day go by Easy to find what be wrong , hard to find what be right I believe in you , I can show you that I can see right through all your empty lie I wo n't stay long in this world so wrong say goodbye as we dance with the devil tonight do n't you dare look at him in the eye as we dance with the devil tonight tremble , crawl across my skin feel your cold dead eye steal the life of mine I believe in you , I can show you that I can see right through all your empty lie I wo n't last long in this world so wrong say goodbye as we dance with the devil tonight do n't you dare look at him in the eye as we dance with the devil tonight hold on , hold on say goodbye as we dance with the devil tonight do n't you dare look at him in the eye as we dance with the devil tonight hold on , hold on ( goodbye ) __________________________ name dance with the devil artist break Benjamin album phobia
