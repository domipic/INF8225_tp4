how do everything start and end ? come gather now and lay this beast to rest I keep hearing trumpet , get my hearing check your father speak a prophecy to think that I believe be self-center of me there be something that I be try to say but then I choke on it and now it be get kinda late we walk to the edge but we never leap , what sing to you when you disconnect write on the wall , the letter plain and tall , this be my own fault we do n't feel anything we do n't feel anything we do n't feel anything we do n't feel anything I still cower at eternal wrath though do n't want my fear to become my shadow I want to evade my thought , I want to die in Kyoto the ocean never sleep or dream , it never stop to ponder what it see commit to its satellite , no one can move you man and no one be ever go to try . all the tide be marry to the moon all i want be for my heart to be as true write on the wall , the letter plain and tall this be my own fault we do n't feel anything not go but fade fast so let me put to rest the only question that you will ask we do n't feel anything we do n't feel anything we do n't feel anything we do n't feel anything we do n't feel anything we do n't feel anything we do n't feel anything we do n't feel anything we do n't feel anything __________ name Mene Artist Brand New album Mene
