well I write your name and burn it to see the color of the flame and it burn out the whole spectrum as if you be everything mine just burn gold a normal flame I be not anything and all that I remember be the feeling of wake up when we be kid , you be the sun to which my eye would not adjust we be kid , I be a fountain you could never drink enough then come all the boy who sweep you up play careless with your heart and every night there be a new girl sit beside me in my car something die when you grow old but you do the good you can I be glad I be glad you find a good man __________________________ name Good Man ( Demo @card@ ) Artist Brand New album leak Demos @card@
