I , I be feel like a veteran uncompensated for the blood I have leave to pool on foreign ground and I sometimes reach to rub at ache leg but they have be dust for over a decade and you be the limb I have lose , but somehow I still feel until I wake , we just hope that you make it we hope that you be celebrate with people you have miss and burning like a beacon , guide our ship around this hellish shoal I be happy to admit that maybe I be a little depressed ' cause I be miss you to death and now there be only record of my memory it be a little thing you give posthumously the detail all drag out to think of all the painting we could be without if Van Gogh have go and die face down from loss of blood the night he go and hack his ear off until I wake , we just hope that you make it we hope that you be celebrate with people you have miss and burning like a beacon , guide our ship around this hellish shoal I be happy to admit that maybe I be a little depressed ' cause I be miss you to death until I wake , we just hope that you make it we hope that you be celebrate with people you have miss and burning like a beacon , guide our ship around this hellish shoal I be happy to admit that maybe I be a little depressed ' cause I be miss you to death until I wake , we just hope that you make it we hope you be as decorate as the day that you leave and burning like a beacon , guide our ship around this hellish shoal I be happy to admit that maybe I be a little depressed ' cause I be missin ' you to death _____________________________ name miss you ( Demo @card@ ) Artist Brand New album leak Demos @card@
