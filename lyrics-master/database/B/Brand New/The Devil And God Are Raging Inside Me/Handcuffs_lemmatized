I will arrest you if I have handcuff , I will arrest you if I have the time , I will throw you down in the back seat , as if you have commit a terrible crime . I will break in a town worth of house , and rob whole family blind , I will do it to you like you do it to me , if you know you would get away fine . I will drown all these crying baby , if I know that their mother would n't cry , I will hold them down and I will squeeze real soft , to let a piece of myself die . it be hard to be the good man , when you forget you be try , it be hard to be the good man . I will arrest you if I have handcuff , I will arrest you if I have the time , I will wait for you outside the courtroom and taunt you when all your appeal be decline I will drive my car off of a bridge , if I know that you be n't inside , with the pedal to the floor who could ask for more , a fantastic way to kill some time . you could lay on your back and be beat you could put up your fist and fight you could try and be way off ( Way Off , Way Off , Way ... way off , Way off ) it be hard be the good man , when you forget you be try , it be hard to be the good man , when you be still lie , it be hard to be the good man , when you forget you be try , it be hard to be the good man , when you be still lie ... you be still lie _______________ name handcuff Artist Brand New album the devil and God be rage inside me
