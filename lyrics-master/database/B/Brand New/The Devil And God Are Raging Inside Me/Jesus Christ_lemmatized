' cause this problem 's gonna last more than the weekend well , Jesus Christ , I be not scare to die I be a little bit scare of what come after do I get the gold chariot ? do I float through the ceiling ? do I divide and pull apart ? ' cause my bright be too slight to hold back all my dark and this ship go down in sight of land and at the gate do Thomas ask to see my hand ? I know you will come in the night like a thief ( I know this song ) but I have have some time alone , to hone my lie technique ( breathe Eve , save that one ) I know you think that I be someone you can trust ( Eve , you be wrong , love ) but I be scared I will get scared , and I swear I will try to never give up ( everyone now ) so do you think that we could work out a sign ? so I will know it be you and that it be over , so I wo n't even try ( they be all on file ) I know you be come for the people like me ( one two three ) but we all get wood and nail we tear down that hatin ' factory yeah , we all get wood and nail we tear down that hatin ' factory yeah , we all get wood and nail and we sleep inside of this machine ( sorry ) __________________ name Jesus Christ Artist Brand New album the devil and God be rage inside me
