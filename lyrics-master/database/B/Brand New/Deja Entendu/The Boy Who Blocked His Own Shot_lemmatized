if it make you less sad I will die by your hand I hope you find out what you want I already know what I be and if it make you less sad we will start talk again you can tell me how vile I already know that I be I will grow old Start act my age I will be a brand new day in a life that you hate a crown of gold a heart that be hard than stone and it hurt a whole lot but it be miss when it have go call me a safe bet I be bet I be not I be glad that you can forgive only hope as time go you can forget if it make you less sad I will move out of the state you can keep to yourself I will keep out of your way and if it make you less sad I will take your picture all down every picture you paint I will paint myself out it be cold as a tomb and it be dark in your room when I sneak to your bed to pour salt in your wound so call it quit or get a grip you say you want a solution but you just want to be miss call me a safe bet I be bet I be not I be glad that you can forgive only hope as time go you can forget so you can forget you can forget you be calm and repose it let your beauty unfold Pale white like the skin stretch over your bone spring keep you ever close you be second hand smoke you be so fragile and thin Standing trial for your sin hold on to yourself the good you can you be the smell before rain you be the blood in my vein call me a safe bet I be bet I be not I be glad that you can forgive only hope as time go you can forget ______________________________________ name the Boy who block his own shot Artist Brand New album Deja Entendu
