if you be travel in the north country fair where the wind hit heavy on the borderline remember me to the one who live there for she once be a true love of mine if you go when the snowflake storm when the river freeze and summer end please see if she have a coat so warm to keep her from the howl wind please see if her hair hang long if it roll and flow all down her breast please see from me if her hair be hang long for that be the way I remember her good I be wonder if she remember me at all so many time I have think and pray in the darkness of my night and the brightness of my day so if you be travel in the north country fair where the wind hit heavy on the borderline remember me to the one who live there for she once be a true love of mine _________________________________ name girl from the North Country Artist Bob Dylan album Nashville skyline
