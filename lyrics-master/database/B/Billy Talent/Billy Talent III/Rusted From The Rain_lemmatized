I stumble through the wreckage , rust from the rain there be nothing leave to salvage , no one left to blame among the break mirror , I do n't look the same I be rust from the rain , I be rust from the rain dissect me ' til my blood run down into the drain my bitter heart be pump oil into my vein I be nothing but a tin man , do n't feel any pain I do n't feel any pain , I do n't feel any pain I be rust from the rain go on , crush me like a flower , rust from the rain come on , strip me of my power , beat me with your chain and if I be the king of coward , you be the queen of pain I be rust from the rain , I be rust from the rain you hang me like a picture , now I be just a frame I use to be your lap dog , now I be just a stray shackle in the graveyard , leave here to decay leave here to decay , leave here to decay I be rust from the rain go on , crush me like a flower , rust from the rain come on , strip me of my power , beat me with your chain and if I be the king of coward , you be the queen of pain I be rust from the rain , I be rust from the rain I be rust from the rain go on , crush me like a flower , rust from the rain come on , strip me of my power , beat me with your chain and if I be the king of coward , you be the queen of pain I be rust from the rain , I be rust from the rain go on , crush me like a flower , rust from the rain come on , strip me of my power , beat me with your chain and if I be the king of coward , you be the queen of pain I be rust from the rain , I be rust from the rain Oh , the sun will shine again , I be rust from the rain I be rust from the rain , oh , the sun will shine again I be rust from the rain __________________________ name rust from the Rain Artist Billy Talent album Billy Talent III
