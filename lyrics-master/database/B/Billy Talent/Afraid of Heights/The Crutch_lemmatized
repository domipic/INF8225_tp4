I should have turn and walk away , but I get tangle in your chain . a trail of dead for all to see , you shut the cage and steal the key . your state of mind reveal , that my love for you be real . they say in time wound heal , but I get nothing leave to steal . my mouth be shut . my lip be seal . you be the crutch , of this disease . and I have be lock in your machine . sit here and rot , or break this deal . I spill my blood on the checker floor . you get me crawl back for more . you set the trap I will take the bait . her bed of nail I cant escape . your state of mind reveal , that my love for you be real . they say in time wound heal , but I get nothing leave to steal . my mouth be shut . my lip be seal . you be the crutch , of this disease . and I have be lock in your machine . sit here and rot , or break this deal . now it be so dark that I ca n't see , the mental scar you leave on me . so dig your nail and grind your tooth , I be in your clutch for eternity . yeah I know it be hard for you to see , the mental scar you leave on me . so dig your nail and grind your tooth , I be in your clutch for eternity . my mouth be shut . my lip be seal . you be the crutch , of this disease . and I have be lock in your machine . sit here and rot , or break this deal . my mouth be shut . my lip be seal . you be the crutch , of this disease . and I have be lock in your machine . sit here and rot , or break this deal . ________________ name the crutch Artist Billy Talent album afraid of Heights
