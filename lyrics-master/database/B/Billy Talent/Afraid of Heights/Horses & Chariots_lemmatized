horse and chariot church and state devotion turn dangerous when arm with rule of faith . prisoner and patriot Angels and saint if mind be persuade enough compassion turn to hate . ( so when the ) Tide come to bury us together we must stay . ( do n't let their ) horse and chariot drag our love away . no ! border and boundary sign draw by red tape those who colour outside of the line define the human race . warlord and suffer eye soldier and slave the side of the fence that we climb determine who be afraid . ( so when the ) Tide come to bury us together we must stay . ( do n't let their ) horse and chariot drag our love away . ( until we ) Swallow our pride our heart will collide . and the sky of hysteria will come rain down on you . cleanse the salt from the hand that divide our world in two . ( so when the ) Tide come to bury us how can we live when so many die ? ( do n't let their ) horse and chariot Hide the view from their eye ( until we ) Swallow our pride we have choose a faith , we have choose a side . ( until we ) Swallow our pride our heart will collide . _______________________ name horse & chariot Artist Billy Talent album afraid of Heights
