wherever I go , wherever I go , I have to question the hand that I hold close . wherever I go , wherever I go , I have to silence the word that you fear most . do n't ever let go , do n't ever let go , be we destine to hit the ground below ? do n't ever let go , do n't ever let go , we be at the end of a burning tightrope . now I be wait on the corner in the back of your mind , it be a lonely place to live , and I get nowhere to hide . ' cause you tell me that you will never be afraid of height again . nobody ever think that we could make it this high , you be the only one I will follow ' til the end of time . if we fall , we fall together baby , do n't think twice again . together I know , together I know , that we will burn like a rocket 's afterglow . together I know , together I know , we could conquer the star beyond this world . we let it all go , we let it all go , I be just a voice on a break radio . we let it all go , we let it all go , we get lose in the constellation . now I be wait on the corner in the back of your mind , it be a lonely place to live , and I get nowhere to hide . ' cause you tell me that you will never be afraid of height again . nobody ever think that we could make it this high , you be the only one I will follow ' til the end of time . if we fall , we fall together baby , do n't think twice again . do n't think twice again . and after all of these year , and all of this time , darling , if I be still a question in your mind , just say the word and this will end . you tell me that you will never be afraid of height . you tell me that you will never be afraid of height . you tell me we should never be afraid of height again . you tell me that you will never be afraid of height . you tell me that you will never be afraid of height . if we fall , we fall together baby , do n't think twice again . wherever I go , wherever I go , I hear your voice on a break radio . wherever I go , wherever I go , I know we will burn like a rocket 's afterglow . do n't ever let go , do n't ever let go , so be we destine to hit the ground below ? do n't ever let go , do n't ever let go , be we just watch the final chapter close ? ________________________________________________ name afraid of Heights ( reprise ) - Demo Version Artist Billy Talent album afraid of Heights
