bury in the mail before the early morning , under the frost that be form , his word be call . even though alarm bell ring without a warning , all of the clock keep tick , and time keep flow . everyone that I hold dearly , I try to keep them close , ' Cause some of them get bite by the rabbit down the hole . once they walk past through the grass , they be never come home . easy to label yet so hard to nail , maybe they have lose their way but find their savior . live in a fabled life be a fairy tale , except our thought be fragile our mind be frail . everyone that you hold dearly , you try to keep them close . ' cause some of them get bite by that rabbit down the hole . and once you walk past through the grass , you be never come home . good god what have I do ? mother nature lonely son . mother nature lonely son . Chase that rabbit down the hole . wander through the open door that lead to nowhere . who be gonna take away my pain , take away my pain . before you know you be trap inside the spider web , scream there be no escape , there be no escape . the invitation be write clearly , you be the one he choose . until the day your bite by the rabbit down the hole . follow his procession deep into the ground below . good god what have I do ? mother nature lonely son . mother nature lonely son . Chase that rabbit down the hole . I will drown or I will burn . down the path of no return . down the path of no return . Chase that rabbit down the hole . rabbit down the hole .
