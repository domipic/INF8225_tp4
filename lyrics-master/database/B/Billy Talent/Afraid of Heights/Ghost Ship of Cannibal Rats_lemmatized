I be tired of look the other way . respect ! an appetite that we ca n't sustain . we be on a mission to kiss our day away . so how long before the river start to rise dear ? yeah I thank my lucky star to be alive here . respect ! a generation of castaway , under a nation of tidal wave . be we the passenger or the prey ? you ca n't escape from the past on holiday . so how long before the river start to rise dear ? pack your bag because the tide be get high . do n't be afraid of the view from the corner because , that be just the Captain and Crew jump off of the mast . all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! who be gonna sound the alarm when the bridge collapse . this be the point where the bomb reach critical mass. all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! catastrophic event do n't change . today we face but tomorrow we pay . but do n't you worry cause we will be safe . I have get a ticket to piss your day away . so how long before the river start to rise dear ? yeah I thank my lucky star to be alive here . do n't be afraid of the view from the corner because , that be just the Captain and Crew jump off of the mast . all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! who be gonna sound the alarm when the bridge collapse . this be the point where the bomb reach critical mass. all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! do n't be afraid of the view from the corner because , that be just the Captain and Crew jump off of the mast . all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! who be gonna sound the alarm when the bridge collapse . this be the point where the bomb reach critical mass. all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! we be sail from the coast . disappear too fast . we be sail from the coast . sink into the past . all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! we be sail from the coast . disappear too fast . we be sail the coast . we can never never come back . all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! all aboard on the ghost ship of cannibal rat ! _________________________________ name ghost ship of cannibal rat Artist Billy Talent album afraid of Heights
