time roll along with the wave a thousand mile away hold you close in the rain seem just like yesterday lose hope in a faraway place and in my hand remain a black and white print of a face I will never see again I give my life to save her the ocean turn to red in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all cut down like lamb at slaughter good man be leave for dead in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all love serve until death do us part I be drift in the dark wounded and wish to fall into your faithful arm I give my life to save her the ocean turn to red in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all cut down like lamb at slaughter good man be leave for dead in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all beneath the sky of hate beyond the sea of pain in heaven I will wait until we meet again I give my life to save her the ocean turn to red in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all cut down like lamb at slaughter good man be leave for dead in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all I give my life to save her the ocean turn to red in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all cut down like lamb at slaughter good man be leave for dead in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all in the fall , in the fall , when the tide take them all ___________________ name the Navy Song Artist Billy Talent album Billy Talent II
