in a crooked little town they be lose and never find Fallen leaf , fall leaf Fallen leave on the ground I hitch a ride until the coast to leave behind all of my ghost Searchin ' for somethin ' I could n't find at home can n't get no job , can you spare a dime ? just one more hit and I will be fine I swear to God this will be my one last time in a crooked little town they be lose and never find Fallen leaf , fall leaf Fallen leave on the ground run away before you drown or the street will beat ya down Fallen leaf , fall leaf Fallen leave on the ground when it get dark in Pigeon Park Voice in my head will soon be feed by the vulture that circle around the dead in a crooked little town they be lose and never find Fallen leaf , fall leaf Fallen leave on the ground run away before you drown or the street will beat ya down Fallen leaf , fall leaf Fallen leave on the ground I never once think I will ever be catch Starin ' at sidewalk , hidin ' my track mark I leave my good friend or do they just leave me ? in a crooked little town they be lose and never find Fallen leaf , fall leaf Fallen leave on the ground in a crooked little town they be lose and never find Fallen leaf , fall leaf Fallen leave on the ground run away before you drown or the street will beat ya down Fallen leaf , fall leaf Fallen leave on the ground run away before you drown Fallen leaf , fall leaf Fallen leave on the ground run away before you drown Fallen leaf , fall leaf Fallen leave on the ground ___________________ name Fallen leave Artist Billy Talent album Billy Talent II
