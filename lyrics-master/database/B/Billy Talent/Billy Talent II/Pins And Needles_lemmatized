never understand how she could Mean so little to so many why do she mean everything to me ? be it worth the pain with no one to blame ? for all of my insecurity how do I ever let you go ? question her good intention jealousy be a bad invention when you push on glass it be bind to break even when she be defensive it just give me more incentive the more you squeeze , the more it slip away I never walk so far on a lonely street with no one there for me be it worth the pain with no one to blame ? for all of my insecurity how do I ever let you go ? accept this confession I be walk on pin and needle you be not my possession I be walk on pin and needle my conscience be vicious I be walk on pin and needle and I be beg forgiveness I be walk on pin and needle I never walk so far on a lonely street with no one there for me it take too long to see her in misery and now it be clear to me that it be worth the pain always take the blame for all your own insecurity how do I ever let you go ? ______________________ name pin and Needles Artist Billy Talent album Billy Talent II
