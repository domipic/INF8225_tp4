drip , drip , drip ... I should n't laugh but I know I be a failure in your eye I know it be daft but I guess that I know it deep inside it feel like we be ready to crack these day , you and I when it be just the two of us , only the two of us I could die you leave my heart like an abandon car old and wear out no use at all but I use to be free we be gonna separate ourselves tonight we be always run scared but holding knife but there be a black chandelier it be cast shadow and lie I will sit in silence for the rest of my life if you will like dress our wound with industrial glove make of wire feel it penetrate the skin we begin to relax when it be just the two of us and a cute little cup of cyanide you leave my heart like an abandon car old and wear out no use at all but I use to be free we be gonna separate ourselves tonight we be always run scared but holding knife but there be a black chandelier it be cast shadow and lie we be gonna separate ourselves tonight we be always run scared but holding knife but there be a black chandelier you leave my heart like an abandon car old and wear out no use at all but I use to be free we be gonna separate ourselves tonight we be always run scared but holding knife but there be a black chandelier it be cast shadow and lie we be gonna separate ourselves tonight we be always run scared but holding knife but there be a black chandelier ______________________ name Black chandelier Artist Biffy Clyro album Opposites
