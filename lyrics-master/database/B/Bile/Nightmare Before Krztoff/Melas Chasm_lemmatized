how do we get out from all they put out ? the feeling be let out , and we give our well out when envy come put on , all you do be look on you ca n't put your shoe on ; convenience be pull you down ... how do we get out of this filthy bed I have make ? it be long and it be overdue , no matter what I have say and suddenly it come to me through all the pain and the misery : all I ever want be you here with me I be not the only victim of stubborn , foolish pride I be not the only one who have something bad to hide and suddenly it come to me through all the lie and the misery : all I ever want be you here with me and suddenly I realize : all I ever , ever need be you here with me , you here with me I be not the only victim of stubborn , foolish pride I be not the only one who have something bad to hide how do we get out ? how do we get out ? how do we get out ? how do we get out ? _________________ name Melas chasm artist bile album nightmare before Krztoff
