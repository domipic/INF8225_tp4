this be my dream as long as I know you ? no doubt at all , these time be over this be my end , this sight be like a nightmare I have the picture in my head ? draw by faith and trust , shape by my conviction ? be this my blame can it be so simple I never realize it I see my vision melting down can not keep it in my hand this be like a fuckin ' dream the drip of my future pull me down encircle by reality , I be dive in my past this sight be a nightmare this sight tatter my heart into rag open window howl at me I see my fear become reality my lung be fill by pain and sorrow by tear and break fuckin ' aim I hope one day we will see us again some day be this the end and I ask myself would you look at me would you remember my face just look me in the eye , one last time everth fade to an ugly grey I never expect an end like this ______________ name December Artist breakdown of Sanity album mirror
