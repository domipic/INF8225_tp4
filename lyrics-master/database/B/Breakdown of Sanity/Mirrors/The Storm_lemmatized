close to the ground , I follow my tear my eye , glare by the lie who be the liar in this cold world where be the traitor your fuckin ' almighty god you can not deny this ship will sink , you know it we will never be free , what have humanity become I will prefer to die rather than become a part of them I see the fuckin ' target get close , just minute away ( but ) no hope at this time my hand , bind by fear my eye , glare by the lie of the mass I try the block , for the very last time you fail , its time to break the rule but I need your help to defeat this storm I miss the shore against the cruel spirit of this sinking wither world I miss the shore it be all up to you , it be all up to me I miss the shore it be all up to us be this the end please tell me you wo n't abandon all hope now hoist the sail my friend never quit , let be cross this storm Eye for an eye we capture your flag Eye for an eye this world can become what we want it to be Eye for an eye . _______________ name the Storm Artist breakdown of Sanity album mirror
