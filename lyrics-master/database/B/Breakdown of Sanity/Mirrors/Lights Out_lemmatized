I take your breath away can you feel remorse retrace all the step , all the thing you have do to me this be the moment where I ca n't control myself you stamp your heel on my neck you force me to taste the poison I be gonna take your breath away I be gonna take your breath away can you feel me now ? this nauseate sickness creep through I think this can only be stop by blood can you feel remorse ? can you see my blood ? it have to late to apologize for all the thing you have do to me you could n't catch the sickness , cure the sickness that I bleed and now I need you to feel the pain of my disease this be the last impression that I be leave you to see I know you need just a reason , but the reason die but the fuckin ' reason die with me everyday I ask myself , how long be this to continue I just follow the voice in my head , the time be now to turn the light out can you see my scar , you ca n't heal anymore I be able to divine your thought now I wo n't break again ________________ name light out artist breakdown of Sanity album mirror
