there be no master plan , I be so confuse and paralyze here where the fuck I be , just dark wall around me as high as mountain my hand on my chest , they feel like a thorn deep inside me this pain bring me down to my knee what be behind those fuckin ' wall I hate the future look for answer my decision be set the track switch through the jungle of this life but what to do if there be more than just one right way I never want that you leave me but I see it in your eye , the trust be already dead all the time I try to cope , I say to myself , look Forward to a new chapter this be my confession , I be still in love with you could I find the way back to you I can feel there be still hope Walls so high I ca n't see the sun anymore - this be a fuck dead end . _______________ name paralyze Artist breakdown of Sanity album mirror
