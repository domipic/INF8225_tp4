I can see through you , you be alone this be the wrong direction I can see through you , you try to look unbreakable you have no reason to celebrate , light out conscious lie behind my back this be what you need to hear you have screw up you make the wrong move oh my fuckin ' god you better watch your fuckin ' back there be a bullet with your fuckin ' name on it you never get a second chance to make a first impression today be like yesterday an empty shell of hate what the hell be up now can n't trust my eye , my ear full of lie what the fuck be go on how do you become what you be an empty shell of hate I can see through you you be alone now watch my rage you exceed the border line you be such an empty shell of hate your fear be spit out the lie hide the truth , disguise reality what be you try this be the wrong direction all these lie be knife , you ca n't handle it cut yourself in piece , I do n't hold you back there be no tomorrow . _____________________ name one bullet Left Artist breakdown of Sanity album mirror
