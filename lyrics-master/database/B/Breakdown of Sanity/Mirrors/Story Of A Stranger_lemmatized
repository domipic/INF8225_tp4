let me wake up this be not my real life year of buildup this ca n't be the end no way please hold me these cold raindrop on my tense face , be this the rain that go along with me let me feel your reliance and hope can we take this barrier together let me feel your hope I wanna let go - no way I do n't wanna hear it now it be the point in time I always fear I can feel the cold wind be strike my shakin ' body not in my life , not with my heart I hate the fate till now I think it would never happen to me again will this break us those be the tear , show me the way this be a common crossing with just one destination Straight into loneliness I wanna leave this nightmare but the door be locked there be no light anymore I hate the fate this be the story of a fuckin ' stranger hit me , let me wake up now , Time disperse like sand in my hand I ca n't believe it I dream about the day it go through our heart find the light . _________________________ name story of a Stranger Artist breakdown of Sanity album mirror
