look back on my footstep on the cold ground , feel like flee they say the path I take should be my fate , but I wanna take my lazy step on my own day by day , second by second , I set the course anew walk through the frame of my life , look for the moment I will remember with a smile trip over lie and hate , envy and vanity I wish I could change the order of proceeding , no chance at all I build a time machine , I will reverse my mistake , pain fade away ! all these source of noise be whisper and scream , tempting and frightening in the middle of my head , beyond my heart they try to change my mind into something bad , fight against them for year but in the end I still decide on my own , fear the mistake , fear the responsibility to myself and to my beloved , to my beloved these photo ... can n't overlook the flashlight , they be surround me , observe all my movement but finally it be me who be cry for my perfect sincerity , cry for my salvation , cry for the respect against for myself so where be the golden means of all decision ? do n't even know if there be a right way I could choose I go down on my knee , I be yell at the ground , in the hope of find some new answer thousand of question , only one life for find answer . one question for thousand of life - breathe slowly - what if despite this I never stop believe in , wait for the point I can see it clearly ______________ name chapter artist breakdown of Sanity album perception
