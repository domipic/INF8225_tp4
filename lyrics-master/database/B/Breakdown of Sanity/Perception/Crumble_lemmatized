the grey cloud obliterate the light blue sky , they be approach quickly the sloppy and filthy street be reflect the human condition everywhere I look I can only see narrow alleyway the bridge be burn no chance to heal the wound , no time-out from the selfish world the cold environment be look at me , in hope of get answer I close my eye to stop the time , to forget all this misery where be I ? where be the place where the rose still grow ? I ca n't hear through these hazy word anymore be this the reality or just my perception ? wait for a sign but you ca n't see me , through this blur visibility but I can see you , the fear in your face , the flutter eyelid , you ca n't hide , you ca n't I perceive there be a way out there be might be a solution that cure the world can n't you feel it ? can you really see it ? so shout out , convince me step up ! you be the gunman , I be just the bullet shot from your gun now _____________ name Crumble Artist breakdown of Sanity album perception
