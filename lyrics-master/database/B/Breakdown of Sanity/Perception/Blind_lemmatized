today my awakening be different I be dazzle by the hidden truth it wake me up with sharp scream , it shake me up be it already too late , be this the last of our fight ? maybe just a dream it shine so fuck bright , tear roll out of my squint eye this be the cold fire , burn down my little hope I get up , I walk down the street again , but today I be just the observer , now I be the see watch all the zombie , I be scare by their ashamed glance their empty face with these glossy eye , try to evade my assessment I see them die within , lose on the way , not ready to pay I walk along , no one hold me back , no one block my path I can read their mind , they have lose their goal , lose their dream , lose their self they do n't know what they be search for now now they feel the consequence of their stiffen way of life , cage in their own prison of lie focus on the fading thing , now the safety fall to dust what be the use of all the money now , can you remember your decision ? I watch ' em pay the price for be blind , for be so narrow-minded the final question be : what if this be just a dream ? be it just a dream ? you blind motherfucker ___________ name Blind Artist breakdown of Sanity album perception
