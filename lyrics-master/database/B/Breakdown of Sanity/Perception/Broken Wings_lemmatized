the fetter be loose now but the redden wrist will be visible forever I be stand on the edge , I have lose almost my spirit , my path something die inside me I do n't recognize myself when I be look in the mirror something have grow inside me what have I become ? I act too late I should have see it but I have go blind more and more I have just hear this ticking in my head I will never feel safe anymore , nowhere nothing will ever gonna be the same again , nothing the surface wo n't be regrinded anymore now I have to conceal my scar which I be try to heal I feel to cry , I cry to feel what a waste , what a dissapointment all the thing you never appreciate like a leech on my neck , you take my energy the wing be break , the rose be black the picture remind only of day of lightness no one can change it , no one to blame just forgive , just forget in spite of all this I refuse to give up , I wo n't give up __________________ name Broken Wings Artist breakdown of Sanity album perception
