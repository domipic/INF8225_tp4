it be the dark night , star invisible the only thing I can feel be your cold fear , your shiver hand , control gaze Fearing the end , await the consequence as long as you be walk this path in fact you do n't have to fear the fog my friend and I see , you already know the other side , you know the way out but the cruel end be etch in your thought your fantasy , only able to envision the bad you dream of a hero , help hand , brave guardian when you wake up you wish to wake up again leave this place be what you secretly hope for but in reality you ca n't run away , in the end the past will catch you all up it be not the case that you be n't responsible take a look at this world , drab and reek look at the dull sea , almost dead inside look at the toxic sky , we and the sun , no long friend now there be no more excuse for walk this path no more chance for the fuck blind all this be make you sad , all this be make you scare the hero be close , he can save you he be close to you , so close to you Reach out your hand , open your eye what make you not change your mind for so long ? that be right , the hero be you __________ name hero artist breakdown of Sanity album perception
