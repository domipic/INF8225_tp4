I forget my own rule , but I still know the end of the story what be happen to the world , what be happen to my life ? there be a time I feel safe , safe from the drossiness , safe from discomfort no enemy no lie where be my soul , where be my way , where be my heart over year it make me weak , it make me unpredictable something come across my way , it change too many thing inside me over year it make me weak I see your smile everything around me seem to glow but everything I touch go out I hold your hand , feel your breath , see your smile I take this gift from life , not know what await me where be my soul , where be my way , where be my heart over year it make me weak another step in an unknown direction , how can I be sure , how can I be sure ? day go by , it seem to grow it feel still right where I be I ca n't see you anymore , feel you anymore these voice be push me , they want me to fail I be fall , nothing to lose , nothing to win how could I be sure , why so sure ? __________________ name Scissorhands Artist breakdown of Sanity album perception
