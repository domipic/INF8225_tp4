I hope there be an end of this story everywhere I go , everytime I sleep I go around in the circle , again and again on my way to a good life , with a free heart , a carefree mind it be join me through time and distance , like my fuckin ' shadow invisible scar , cause by myself , so deep inside me I play with the fire in my heart it have finally catch me they tell me it be time for change the beauty entice me to risk so many mistake why not , why not ? ! the sign be clear , the cloud be here who know , maybe they be still right , maybe there will be rain again maybe I can forget , to forget the sadness just another aberration ? just a delusion ? so here we go , round @card@ , and I be doubtful again the shadow of the past so dark , make my life look empty I hope there be an end of this story every night I dream of the love I live twice every morning I wake up with memory of thing that never happen alone in the crowd , maybe already forget I see the time be work against me I guess I ca n't stop this , because it be strong than me impossible to learn the lesson , as long as my heart wo n't listen the circle hold me back , I be strap down wait for the day I can break through , the moment I can catch up all the love wait for the day , you be n't just a dream , no ! _____________________ name invisible scar artist breakdown of Sanity album perception
