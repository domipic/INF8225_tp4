it be a long way , it take a long time to find a safety like this I be almost give up all my hope but in the end the picture in my head surpass my expectation a world so perfect , a world so fuckin ' flawless the search have an end , I do n't need anything else other than this place , a place where I belong nothing be grey , even the dark cloud above me shine bright the ocean so deep , my spirit above no more question , only answer I take a deep breath , close my eye , reach out my hand and try to stop the time to feel the perfection for longer the warm , pleasant sunbeam on my face , the sand between my toe and the breeze in my hair no one can take this moment away from me please do n't take me away from this place , please do n't wake me up from the place where I belong ________________________________________ name deliverance ( feat .
