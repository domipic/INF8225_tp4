I be fall for a long time almost everything I know become more fuck worthless so many promise , so much energy all I want be silence , all I want be peace , all I want be you no more reason for search for what I always expect from life New direction , new fuckin ' rule you catch me on my way to my new life I think it be time to act selfishly Memories of a time before distrust and pain perhaps a dream , perhaps a trap but not this time , it be too different my pulse be slow down , my eye be close now and I create a picture in my head , a picture of the time I draw it with my mind , it be colourful and bright it be no longer wait , from today it be arrive this time I can see the sky , the first time I do n't look back no more wall , no more lie , I can breathe until after the sundown my glowing heart , just awaken perfection within reach my sad memory , you make them look like fade dust I be the air , I be the ground , nothing can burn me down I really miss this feeling , now I do n't fear myself anymore open mind , open way , my future turn to light Hope have come to find me , my real destination this be the control I be wait for , it make me unbreakable I remember who I be , what i be , what i have become ______________ name the Gift Artist breakdown of Sanity album perception
