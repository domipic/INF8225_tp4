another sleepless night , time stand still , minute seem like hour , hour like day I take a deep breath , open my eye and clench my hand into a fist all these nightmare , they hunt me for real running away be futile , stand still be fatal can n't distinguish between sweat and blood anymore be it our fault ? we know we could fail I feel numb from drink our tear , but when I remember your smile I know I have to face all this fear I enter your room , close the door , smell your perfume it hurt like an open sore , which will bleed forever be it me , that end our dream ? somebody please cut me out of this twisted picture I be float in memory , they feel like fracture reflect on everything , since you disappear if there be one moment you can choose your fate why do n't we grow in love , instead of end up in a fuckin ' fight Oh god , why ? ! tell me why I feel numb from drink our tear , but when I remember your smile I know I have to face all this fear you take the key , start the car , drive into nowhere ... with my heart now it all fall apart I enter your room , close the door , whisper your name another sleepless night , time stand still , minute seem like hour , hour like day it be our fault , we know we could fail ________________________ name cardiac Silhouette Artist breakdown of Sanity album perception
