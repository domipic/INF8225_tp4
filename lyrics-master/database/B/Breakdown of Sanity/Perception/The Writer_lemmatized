it be your turn right now let me see your step , let me feel your hesitation nothing venture , nothing gain we know the reproach to yourself all your reflection as an open secret all your mistake as a success , your tear as the pitiful disport your decision make us win , follow the guide we give you do n't look upward , there be nothing above you , your eye be n't qualify your memory be your future , can you remember your end ? we be your faith and your fear we be your inspiration and your overload you be all equal this be your reality , your veiled sight you can never see you can put the blame on us I see you try to grow with your scar , but you fail again and again you can put the blame on us , this be what we expect this make your life so much easy , just close your eye , follow blindly in your deep dream you can see us , in your lonely hour you can feel us this prison be build for you , you be not ready for the outside maybe you will never be , maybe you will never see nothing be more constant than change so why do n't you change within ? position wo n't change as long as you ca n't see the point till then we will keep observe you..sneering ________________ name the Writer Artist breakdown of Sanity album perception
