you make me bleed inside stop hide and seek it 's time to face the fact I think we reach our flatline now what have we become ? this be human error a bloodbath with no sense in it so finish harass me you be like the perfect murder you act with no remorse no empathy at all but I miss your disease Miss your disease / it be your disease your game , your rule this be my system 's failure / self-destructive a throat cut of consciousness I be still suffocate it be your game , your rule I never really get a chance to win against your mania but listen , , fuck your trip ! this time you be no crack addict anyway , I wish you some peace of mind Hope you can change a bit and breath for a while ... _____________________ name Cancer 's breath artist breakdown of Sanity album the last sunset
