I feel so incomplete I never want to change , but I think I be gonna fold it be all the same to me I ca n't erase the darkness in my mind I ca n't rise I be fall down again last hope so I want my life back I think I be strong enough to pull the string of life but you be pull away another fight to wish away the loneliness another face that I do n't know I will drown in this life give me something good and I will fuck it up I will fuck it up tear of angel be fall down and I hope to get them if I do n't get my way my dream be fade now I try to be the man I really be my dream be fade now I do n't know what to do but sit here and wait for the end of the world I want my new life tell me now how should I feel fuck you . _____________________________ name view through blind eye artist breakdown of Sanity album the last sunset
