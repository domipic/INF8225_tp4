sorrow now our world have enter in this dark age of inane bloodshed blind by hate , slave by fear the face be mark by sorrow can n't you see the sign ? ! shade by dreadful crime greed and selfish plan sometimes it be hard to distinguish between day and night can you feel the blame where be the resistance ! ? that will be the last chance you know that you act without human sanity you make thing unforgiveable with your fuckin selfish plan regardless of the consequence you be a pain in the neck I think a bullet be the only way lifeless ! one bullet left betrayal be break up the trust it be like a sickness so fight against the violence betrayal be break up the trust it be like a sickness this be our resistance . ________________ name Resistance Artist breakdown of Sanity album the last sunset
