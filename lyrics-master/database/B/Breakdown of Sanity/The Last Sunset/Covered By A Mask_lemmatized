my tear be dark like the night I have never feel so cold like this break away from you I can see the smile on your face I spend my lifetime Hope - I be hope it would come to me we cover by a mask I be still alive but without eye I be die deep within try to replace change my life but then I suffocate I lose the lie I have never realize the fuckin truth there be more in this world than I think to see you be nothing well you can not hide ' cause you wo n't change your face I spend my lifetime Hope - I be hope it would come to me we cover by a mask I be cover by a mask you wo n't forget me there be nothing I would change give a chance to rearrange I would n't part with a single day , not today where be my sunrise ? where be my horizon to begin again to descry a new life for some hope because hope die last regret till death because hope die last I can not hide behind a mask of utter satisfaction I be feel all this you will lose your face ! _______________________ name cover by a Mask Artist breakdown of Sanity album the last sunset
