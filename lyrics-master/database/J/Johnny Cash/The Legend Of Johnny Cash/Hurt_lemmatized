I hurt myself today to see if I still feel I focus on the pain , the only thing that be real the needle tear a hole , the old familiar sting try to kill it all away but I remember everything what have I become , my sweet friend everyone I know go away in the end and you could have it all , my empire of dirt I will let you down , I will make you hurt I wear this crown of thorn upon my liar chair full of break thought I can repair beneath the stain of time the feeling disappear you be someone else , I be still right here what have I become , my sweet friend everyone I know go away in the end and you could have it all , my empire of dirt I will let you down , I will make you hurt if I could start again , a million mile away I would keep myself , I would find a way __________ name Hurt Artist Johnny Cash album the Legend of Johnny Cash
