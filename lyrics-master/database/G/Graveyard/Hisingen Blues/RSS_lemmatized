get start really early , get no time to hesitate the star be right to get to hell , from the dog that bite me back break a nose or break a leg , do you think that I give a damn ? I will never know it be over I bring the bottom to the blind there be no bottom when I run , no tomorrow when I be do when you look into that hole , you discover it destroy the soul get no time to die there be no point to life and if you judge me and point finger , have a look at yourself Bring me ... and some wine I behave like a ... swine ... and maybe some booze , please bring me my run shoe a tambourine and load of beer , you do n't wanna be around here it be something , I have enough I want more of that brown stone there be no bottom when I run , no tomorrow when I be do when you look into that hole , you discover it destroy the soul get no time to die Got no point to life O-o-oh , a-a-ah O-o-oh , a-a-ah O-o-oh , a-a-ah O-o-oh , a-a-ah ... ... I have tell you once , I have tell you twice , you can never change my life ... and play the blues , ... drink the booze but sometimes ... that be when all hell break loose there be no bottom when I run , no tomorrow when I be do when you look into that hole , you discover it destroy the soul get no time to die Got no point to life and if you judge me and point finger , have a look at yourself _________ name RSS Artist graveyard album Hisingen Blues
