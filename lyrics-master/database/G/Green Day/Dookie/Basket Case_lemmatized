do you have the time to listen to me whine about nothin ' and everything all at once ? I be one of those melodramatic fool neurotic to the bone , no doubt about it sometimes I give myself the creep sometimes my mind play trick on me it all keep addin ' up , I think I be crackin ' up be I just paranoid , be I just stone ? I go to a shrink to analyze my dream she say it be lack of sex that be bringin ' me down I go to a whore , he say my life be a bore so quit my whine ' cause it be bringin ' her down sometimes I give myself the creep sometimes my mind play trick on me it all keep addin ' up , I think I be crackin ' up be I just paranoid ? yeah , yeah , yeah go , go grasp to control so I well hold on sometimes I give myself the creep sometimes my mind play trick on me it all keep addin ' up , I think I be crackin ' up be I just paranoid , be I just stone ? _________________ name Basket Case Artist Green Day album Dookie
