I walk a lonely road the only one that I have ever know do n't know where it go but it be home to me and I walk alone I walk this empty street on the boulevard of break dream where the city sleep and I be the only one and I walk alone I walk alone I walk alone I walk alone I walk a- my shadow be the only one that walk beside me my shallow heart be the only thing that be beat sometimes I wish someone out there will find me till then I walk alone Ah-ah , ah-ah , ah-ah , ah-ah Ah-ah , ah-ah , ah-ah I be walk down the line that divide me somewhere in my mind on the borderline of the edge and where I walk alone read between the line what be fuck up and everything 's alright check my vital sign to know I be still alive and I walk alone I walk alone I walk alone I walk alone I walk a- my shadow be the only one that walk beside me my shallow heart be the only thing that be beat sometimes I wish someone out there will find me till then I walk alone Ah-ah , ah-ah , ah-ah , ah-ah Ah-ah , ah-ah I walk alone I walk a- I walk this empty street on the boulevard of break dream where the city sleep and I be the only one and I walk a- my shadow be the only one that walk beside me my shallow heart be the only thing that be beat sometimes I wish someone out there will find me till then I walk alone ________________________________ name Boulevard of Broken dream Artist Green Day album Boulevard of Broken dream
