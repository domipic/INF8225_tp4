oh man , I be tired and lonely again , why must it be a man be drown slowly and he ca n't keep above go way too deep , oh yeah open sky be fall , tear be come down . like a drop of rain fall to the ocean and come back around one rainy day Oh , so many time I should have crawl when I go run by and since then I have be leave feel traumatize , yea rape and drain of an innocence a gift we have lose over time and still I gaze through this one rainy day alone with no one by my side open sky be fall , tear be come down . like a drop of rain fall to the ocean and come back around , yeah I swear I have give , I have give you all I can never will you ever make me feel this way again , oh on this one rainy day Hey , open sky be fall , tear be come down . like a drop of rain fall to the ocean and come back around one rainy day one rainy day Oh one rainy day it have be just one rainy day ___________________ name one rainy Day Artist Godsmack album IV write by James Shannon Larkin , Rob Merrill , Salvatore P.
