as I sit here and slowly close my eye I take another deep breath and feel the wind pass through my body I be the one in your soul reflect inner light protect the one who hold you cradle your inner child I-I need serenity in a place where I can hide I need serenity nothing change , day go by where do we go when we just do n't know , and how do we relight the flame when it be cold ? why do we dream when our thought mean nothing , and when will we learn to control ? tragic vision slowly steal my life Tore away everything cheat me out of my time I be the one who love you no matter wrong or right and every day I hold you I hold you with my inner child I-I need serenity in a place where I can hide I need serenity nothing change , day go by where do we go when we just do n't know , and how do we relight the flame when it be cold ? why do we dream when our thought mean nothing , and when will we learn to control ? where do we go when we just do n't know , and how do we relight the flame when it be cold ? why do we dream when our thought mean nothing , and when will we learn to control ? ( I need serenity ) where do we go when we just do n't know , ( I need serenity ) and how do we relight the flame when it be cold ? ( I need serenity ) why do we dream when our thought mean nothing , ( I need serenity ) and when will we learn to control ? ______________ name Serenity Artist Godsmack album faceless write by Salvatore P.
