creep up again lose myself and it be too late kill time again wait for my only fate trap within the cage that I have build with my own hand can n't release the rage shatter life and break plan if I know myself I would n't keep on do this but I trick myself and believe with just one kiss I ca n't believe the thing I do all for the sake of please you in the dark again afraid to move but ca n't sit still kill my heart again to myself I give this pill if I be myself I will find strength to push away but I hurt myself and I weaken more each day I ca n't believe the thing I do all for the sake of please you as I come to know you my disgust grow anew as you tighten your grip my worn throat slowly slit I ca n't believe the thing I do all for the sake of please you I should just stop and let you know but I be afraid of let go let go ________________ name let Go Artist godhead album nothingness
