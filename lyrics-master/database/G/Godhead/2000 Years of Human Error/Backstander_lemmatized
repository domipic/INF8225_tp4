I wish I be free now you drive me into a place where I barely can hide from you moment at a time you know I never sleep to keep myself away from you ? I be always turn around to see you star on my back sometimes I find that my delivery be all the same and when I look at you I instinctively start the game I never see what you mean when you Start to weep and scream at me oh no , the ringing in my head again ! oh no , you be rip off my face again ! you know I never sleep to keep myself away from you ? I be always turn around to see you star on my back why ? you be just a pretty face you be just a pretty face you know I never sleep to keep myself away from you ? I be always turn around to see you star on my back _________________ name Backstander Artist godhead album @card@ year of human error write by James M . O'connor , Jason Charles Miller , Michael K .
