sift through the ash of my life I think I find the one that I could always trust slowly I begin to learn that I can never judge the thing that mean the most to me and all the hate and anger they all put on you you just throw on me and I do n't believe that I could ever be with you and I do n't believe that we could ever be together call out to you , try to show the truth but you just carry on kill everything that we once have and never really understand why and I do n't believe that I could ever be with you and I do n't believe that we could ever be together you have take everything and leave me here with nothing take everything and leave me here with nothing you have take everything and leave me here with nothing take everything and leave me here with nothing you have take everything and leave me here with nothing take everything and leave me here with nothing and I do n't believe that I could ever be with you and I do n't believe that we could ever be together ___________________ name afterthought artist godhead album Power Tool Stigmata write by Miller , Jason Charles , Hepperlin , Ullrich Gerd
