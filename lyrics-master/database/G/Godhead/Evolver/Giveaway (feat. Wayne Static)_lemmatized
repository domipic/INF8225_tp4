I could be like everything you want give you everything I have get inside take me to the place where I can never be free Rip my last hope right out of me do n't you think that you be special you could be anyone take the place of another Cycle of delirium ( just give me away I betray , I be useless anyway just give me away I pray that everyday will be my last just give me away ) I could turn myself into a miracle man Bow before the thing you hold sacred sparkling example of the one that you want leave your existence mine to haunt do n't you think this be unreal you could be anyone take the place of another end it all with a gun ( just give me away I betray , I be useless anyway just give me away I pray that everyday will be my last just give me away ) and it feel the same with anyone and I know this have be overdo now it feel the same with everyone as I burn into oblivion ( just give me away I betray , I be useless anyway just give me away I pray that everyday will be my last just give me away ) now you see your time be do ( just give me away ) Fill your space with anyone ( just give me away ) now you see your time be do ( just give me away ) Fill your space with anyone ( just give me away ) now you see your time be do ( I betray , I be useless anyway ) ( just give me away ) Fill your space with anyone ( I pray that everyday will be my last ) ( just give me away ) ___________________________________ name giveaway ( feat .
