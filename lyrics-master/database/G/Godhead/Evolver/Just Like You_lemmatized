the great demise another life I will never reach anything I want to to bend the time I pine away behind the mask of mandatory joy can n't keep from run away do you see ? this be my destiny I want to be like you I want to live off the thing that you always do I want to be renew I want to know what it be like to be just like you I wait in line I walk the shallow empty hall a terror in my mind wait for you I start to realize that you be stand where I should have be Ca n't keep from fall apart do you see ? it be my catastrophe I want to be like you I want to live off the thing that you always do I want to be renew I want to know what it be like to be just like you I will take your place look for my face inside your nightmare tonight I want to be like you I want to live off the thing that you always do I want to be renew I want to know what it be like to be just like you just like you just like you just like you just like you ___________________ name just like you artist godhead album evolver
