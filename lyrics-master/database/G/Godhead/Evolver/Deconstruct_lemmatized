I have fall in far to deep there be no fear of lose sleep I will never feel peace again in life there be no turn back this time it be too late to change my mind I be trap in this box of paranoia close my blind eye to what you have do to me you have deconstruct me so I will bleed your sicken life dry I be kill your world outside the wall you have fortify be crumble down with your self pride I be take the word you have say repeat them in my head destroy your lie be my salvation close my blind eye to what you have do to me you have deconstruct me so I will bleed your sicken life Dry , dry , dry will bleed your sicken life dry close my blind eye to what you have do to me you have deconstruct me so I will bleed your sicken life close my blind eye to what you have do to me you have deconstruct me so I will bleed your sicken life dry _________________ name Deconstruct Artist godhead album evolver
