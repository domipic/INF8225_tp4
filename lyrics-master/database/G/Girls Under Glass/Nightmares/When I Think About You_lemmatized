we stay together , together in my dream , when we be close love be to be see yeah I can feel you , hear your distant voice , from another world love be our choice when I think about you , when I close my eye , I can see your smile , I feel you nearby when I think about you ... then I recognize how much I love you I love you Miles from nowhere , nowhere where you be , this lonely highway my thought escape so far another world another life be in my head , through all that distance it be true what I say when I think about you , when I close my eye , I can see your smile , I feel you nearby when I think about you , when I close my eye , then I recognize how much I love you yeah when I think about you , when I close my eye , I can see your smile , I feel you nearby when I think about you , when I close my eye , then I recognize how much I love you when I think about you , when I close my eye , I can see your smile , I feel you nearby when I think about you ... then I recognize how much I love you when I think about you when I think about you ____________________________ name when I think about you artist girl under Glass album nightmare
