when your leg do n't work like they use to before and I ca n't sweep you off of your foot will your mouth still remember the taste of my love will your eye still smile from your cheek and darling I will be love you till we be seventy and baby my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three and I be thinking ' bout how people fall in love in mysterious way maybe just the touch of a hand Oh me I fall in love with you every single day and I just wanna tell you I be so honey now take me into your loving arm Kiss me under the light of a thousand star place your head on my beating heart I be think out loud that maybe we find love right where we be when my hair be all but go and my memory fade and the crowd do n't remember my name when my hand do n't play the string the same way I know you will still love me the same ' Cause honey your soul can never grow old it be evergreen and baby your smile be forever in my mind and memory and I be thinking ' bout how people fall in love in mysterious way maybe it be all part of a plan I will just keep on make the same mistake hope that you will understand but baby now take me into your loving arm Kiss me under the light of a thousand star place your head on my beating heart I be think out loud that maybe we find love right where we be so baby now take me into your loving arm Kiss me under the light of a thousand star oh darling , place your head on my beating heart I be think out loud that maybe we find love right where we be oh maybe we find love right where we be and we find love right where we be _______________________ name thinking out Loud Artist Ed Sheeran album x
