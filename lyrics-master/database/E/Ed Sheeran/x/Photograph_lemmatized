Loving can hurt , love can hurt sometimes but it be the only thing that I know when it get hard , you know it can get hard sometimes it be the only thing that make us feel alive we keep this love in a photograph we make these memory for ourselves where our eye be never close our heart be never break and time be forever freeze still so you can keep me inside the pocket of your rip jean hold me close until our eye meet you wo n't ever be alone , wait for me to come home Loving can heal , love can mend your soul and it be the only thing that I know I swear it will get easy , remember that with every piece of you , and it be the only thing we take with us when we die we keep this love in a photograph we make these memory for ourselves where our eye be never close our heart be never break and time be forever freeze still so you can keep me inside the pocket of your rip jean hold me close until our eye meet you wo n't ever be alone and if you hurt me that be okay baby , only word bleed inside these page you just hold me and I wo n't ever let you go wait for me to come home wait for me to come home wait for me to come home wait for me to come home oh you can fit me inside the necklace you get when you be sixteen next to your heartbeat where I should be keep it deep within your soul and if you hurt me that be okay baby , only word bleed inside these page you just hold me and I wo n't ever let you go when I be away , I will remember how you kiss me under the lamppost back on Sixth Street Hearing you whisper through the phone wait for me to come home ________________ name photograph Artist Ed Sheeran album x
