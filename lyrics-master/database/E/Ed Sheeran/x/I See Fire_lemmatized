oh misty eye of the mountain below Keep careful watch of my brother ' soul and should the sky be fill with fire and smoke keep watch over Durin 's son if this be to end in fire then we shall all burn together watch the flame climb high into the night call out father oh , stand by and we will watch the flame burn auburn on the mountainside and if we should die tonight , we should all die together raise a glass of wine for the last time call out father oh , prepare as we will watch the flame burn auburn on the mountainside Desolation come upon the sky now I see fire inside the mountain , I see fire burn the tree and I see fire hollow soul I see fire Blood in the breeze and I hope that you remember me oh should my people fall then surely I will do the same confine in mountain hall , we get too close to the flame call out father oh , hold fast and we will watch the flame burn auburn on the mountainside Desolation come upon the sky now I see fire inside the mountain I see fire burn the tree and I see fire hollow soul I see fire Blood in the breeze and I hope that you remember me and if the night be burn I will cover my eye for if the dark return then my brother will die and as this sky be fall down , it crash into this lonely town and with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people scream out and I see fire inside the mountain I see fire burn the tree I see fire hollow soul I see fire Blood in the breeze I see fire oh you know I see a city burning ( Fire ) and I see fire feel the heat upon my skin ( Fire ) and I see fire oh ( Fire ) and I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside ________________ name I see Fire Artist Ed Sheeran album x
