I meet this girl late last year she say " do n't you worry if I disappear " I tell her " I be not really look for another mistake " I call an old friend think that the trouble would wait but then I jump right in a week later , return I reckon she be only look for a lover to burn but I give her my time for two or three night then I put it on pause until the moment be right I go away four month until our path cross again she tell me " I be never look for a friend maybe you could swing by my room around ten Baby , bring the lemon and a bottle of gin we will be in between the sheet till the late AM " Baby , if you want me then should have just say , she 's singing do n't fuck with my love that heart be so cold all over my arm I do n't wanna know that , babe do n't fuck with my love I tell her she know take aim and reload I do n't wanna know that , babe for a couple week I only wanna see her we drink away the day with a takeaway pizza before a text message be the only way to reach her now she be stay at my place and love the way I treat her singing out Aretha , all over the track like a feature and never want to sleep , I guess that I do n't want to either but me and her , we make money the same way four city , two plane , the same day and those show have never be what it be about but maybe we will go together and just figure it out I will rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch but we should get on a plane or we will be miss it now Wish I will have write it down , the way that thing play out but she be kiss him , how ? I be confuse about she should figure it out , while I be sit here sing do n't fuck with my love that heart be so cold all over my arm I do n't wanna know that , babe do n't fuck with my love I tell her she know take aim and reload I do n't wanna know that , babe * Knock knock knock * on my hotel door I do n't even know if she know what for she be cry on my shoulder , but I already tell Ya Trust and respect be what we do this for I never intend to be next but you do n't need to take him to bed , that be all and I never see him as a threat until you disappear with him to have sex , of course it be not like we be both on tour we be stay on the same fuck hotel floor and I be n't look for a promise or commitment but it be never just fun , and I think you be different this be not the way you realize what you want it be a bit too much , too late if I be honest all this time , God know I be sing do n't fuck with my love that heart be so cold all over my arm I do n't wanna know that , babe do n't fuck with my love I tell her she know take aim and reload I do n't wanna know that , babe do n't fuck with my love that heart be so cold all over my arm I do n't wanna know that , babe do n't fuck with my love I tell her she know take aim and reload I do n't wanna know that , babe ___________ name do n't Artist Ed Sheeran album x
