I never walk on the moon I never see the pyramid I be never strike by famine or fortune I will never experience the world you inhabit I will never experience the world you inhabit I never swim with dolphin I never sing from a mountain top I be no inventor and no archaeologist I fret not , I fret not for I have make my own discovery I fret not , I fret not for I have make my own discovery I fret not , I fret not , I fret not I fret not , I fret not , I fret not just put your weight on my shoulder for when I dive into your iris My brain erupt into biochemical mayhem and I feel like a man with two heart , with two heart I fret not , I fret not for I have make my own discovery I fret not , I fret not for I have make my own discovery I fret not , I fret not , I fret not I fret not , I fret not , I fret not just put your weight on my shoulder put your weight on my shoulder put your weight on my shoulder put your weight on my shoulder put your weight on my shoulder put your weight on my shoulder put your weight on my shoulder ( so put your weight on my shoulder ) _______________________________ name Dear Future historian ...
