this be an appeal to the struggle and strive stakeholder of this planet , this floating rock we call earth . alas , that mean you . that mean everyone of your acquaintance , every figure your eye skim past in the street , every charlatan still to defeat , every tender face you find solace in - now mimic the mindset William Wallace be in . dismount , disembark , descend from your existence , slacken your angst and decant your hate ' cause in the long run they be about as useful as pour acid onto your dinner plate . to muzzle mass that lead life of deafen desperation : with Excalibur aloft King Arthur earn the throne but it be our mind we gotta wrench out of stone . do n't be fool by its simplicity , there be never a broadcast make of such urgency ' cause at no time before us do we grasp the scope of this emergency . ladle out love and logic by the boatload , equip with that cargo you can take any road . now grab life , seize time . this fight be for human kind . I be a mindsweeper , focus on me . I be a mindsweeper , focus on me . I will read your mind . I dart through rapids , through the stream of thought , then suddenly I start lose my mind . catapult through the uncharted I could no longer tell if these be your thought or mine . and it be as if I hold a mirror up to my soul , hold a mirror up to my soul . it be as if I hold a mirror up to my soul . who be the author and who be the observer ? who be the author and who be the observer ? for at the last analysis our thought coalesce . you be not alone . you be not alone . you have enter volatile territory , you have start a journey , you be part of this story . and this , this be just a glimpse , just a glimpse . you have no idea what you have get yourself into . you have no idea what you have get yourself into . I be a mindsweeper , focus on me . I be a mindsweeper , focus on me , on me . __________________________________ name the appeal & the Mindsweep I Artist Enter shikari album the Mindsweep
