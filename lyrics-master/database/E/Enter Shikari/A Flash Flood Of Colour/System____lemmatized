there be a house in a field on the side of the cliff and the wave crash below be just say to be a myth so they ignore the warning from the ship and the dock now the house on the cliff be the wreckage on the rock there be a house in a field on the side of the cliff and the wave crash below be just say to be a myth so they ignore the warning from the ship and the dock now the house on the cliff be the wreckage on the rock nothing can fix the building flawed foundation but scaffolding and stilt be the law and legislation this house be doom but they do n't care they invest in a system that be beyond repair when I be little I dress up as an astronaut and explore outter space I dress up as a super hero and run about the place I dress up as a fireman and rescue those in need I dress up as a doctor and cure every disease it be crystal clear to me back then that the only problem that I could face would be the same problem that effect us all but of course this sense of common existence be suck out of me in an instance as though from birth I could walk but I be force to crawl so this be such exciting time to be alive our generation get to fight to survive it be in your hand now the future our future ! our future ! _______________ name System ...
