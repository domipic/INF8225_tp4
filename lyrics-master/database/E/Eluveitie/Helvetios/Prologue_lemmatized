when I reminisce about all those year , I see many thing . life and death string together like the mountain and valley in which we live . there be wealth and opulence , but also tribulation and loss . there be laughter and ong , and there be also tear . but even more than tear , blood be shed . and so many be leave to their unadorned grave , unburied . but to us , death be but another journey . and close by the darkness through which we stride , there be also light . the light of life and immortality . and after all , when I reminisce about those year , I mostly remember our song . we sing as if to drown out the sound of clash sword , as if the battle cry fall silent . because war have lose its meaning . ______________ name prologue Artist Eluveitie album Helvetios
