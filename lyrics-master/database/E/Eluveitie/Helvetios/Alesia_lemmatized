the grass be as green as it always be that sinister day the blackbird sing their song as they always do that black-letter day the day we pass the great gate for the very last time I do not look back , I know we will stay I know they I would not let us go leave the death strip I see the gleam in their eye of fear and enslavement suffering from the crush weight Beloveth grind take me home Alesia , alisanos Wake me when I be go Iânotoutâ , eternity proclaim our barren sacrifice on that ground we cherish life Wr embrace death as the child 's cry trail off sob yield deathly hush the grass as green as it always be that sinister day as we walk the alley like thousand time before I know we will stay outside Alesia we offer a live sacrifice outside the door of Alesia where our tear run dry ____________ name Alesia Artist Eluveitie album Helvetios
