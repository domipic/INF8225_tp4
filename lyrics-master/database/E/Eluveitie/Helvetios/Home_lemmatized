in these vigilant time I daydream - an innocuous crime my motionless stance - in my mind , I wander the land a bleak and dismal trance constrain , unsafe , leave in shame and now I can see my town be paint red here forever I will be where once my tear be shed on that day , in our place I recall the smell of the rain and I will protect you from them if you want me to take , take you there again good night my love , let me watch , you sleep from here or above word like these wo n't leave this place be haunt by our trace , the trace of our ... home the home they want call their own but for the air that I breathe , the dream be divine the memory I will bring to a place far from home the home they want to call province of Rome I be trap without guard , within a state I ca n't grasp but we be still free I be wait for the cloud to part , all in vain nature forsake once admire by us all , do it know we be scared scare to move , scare to wake , scare just to be who we be what matter be just you and me and the path that lead us ... encircle by friend , the pressure deepen daze by illusion , my reason weaken but I wo n't let you fall into deep forlornness I wo n't let you ponder the why in distress a mechanical smile as I lift my face towards the sun and return to denial I weep as I kiss the ground , the tree that I will soon miss the song we sing will ring out , the memory will resound __________ name Home Artist Eluveitie album Helvetios
