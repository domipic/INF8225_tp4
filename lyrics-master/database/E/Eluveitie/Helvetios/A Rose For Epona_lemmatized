do you feel the thorn ? do you see the tear ? do you see the blood shed in this fell war ? have you forsake us ? have you forget our faithful man call your name ? while I stand before you while we perish while I lie down a crimson rise while holding hand be force apart while hope bog like condemn man be you there ? the sky be fall on me as your hand be turn old and weak I be give myself up to thee a futile sacrifice go sere in your nemeton these grey stone wall be cold and silent as the fall Mother go deaf mistress of shattered hope and forever break dream be you there ? the sky be fall on me as your hand be turn old and weak I be give myself up to thee a futile sacrifice go sere Epo , epo why have thou forsake me ? together we go unsung into thy hand I commend my spirit together we go down with our people be you there ? be you there ? the sky be fall on me as your hand be turn old and weak I be give myself up to thee a futile sacrifice go sere Falling on me ... ______________________ name a Rose for Epona Artist Eluveitie album Helvetios
