it have be decide . we will set forth on this journey . we pack the wagon everything arrange , there be no turn back the time have come all too soon a stab all through my heart the afterglow glimmer on the roof of our homestead we bode the nightfall at hand Belive set out into the dark in this night the fire roar as field be set ablaze it rain ash from the sky in a flare hiss at night Forward the land we know off to far and distant shore a safe haven off to these Santonian Shores at the set of the sun as mist billowed over the land we get under way wandering , towards our hope I bode awhile and look back Gaued into the sea of flame lay waste what we call home I wo n't see this place again a cortege as far as the eye can see a vast migrant parade the glow of a distant dream the awakening come nigh under a starlit sky dream within our heart step by step we march away into the night ______________________ name Santonian Shores Artist Eluveitie album Helvetios
