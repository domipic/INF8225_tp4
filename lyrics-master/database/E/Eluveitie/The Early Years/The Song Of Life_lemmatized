I have be fire , feed by the four wind I have be water in the stream and a drop of dew on the culm I have be clay in the hand of a potter I have be rosin of a tree and a leaf , by the breeze carry away I have be a child of seven spirit I have be an eagle in the sky and the swash fish in the lough fulgent I have be star in the loose sky I have be a tear in the wind and a word within paean I have be a flower on the green pasture I have be the song of a bird and the vast roar of a bear I be a lump of this vivid soil I be the brother of the tree a chthonian lot of this earth breathe this dream , and let your soul inhale it ! bare and naked , let us dance on the meadow Revel within this nature which we be all a part of . free this wolf forever ! free this child ! Indui uelui cantla canamos . ______________________ name the song of Life Artist Eluveitie album the early year
