... the endless knot ... . the holy grove ... ... the threshold ... the place beyond ... ... I enter , like a newborn child ... . embrace the eternal like a consuming fire the knowledge grow when it be cleave though still patchworked yet flood the create touch wash away the vile . embrace the ancient while tree gently whisper those intimate longed-for word the greet wheel be still revolving with untouchable sovereignty so invulnerable . into the sacred grove I drown the endless knot draw me into the fire of heart , the place beyond then I will be bear then I will be renew ... naked spirit ... bare ... spirit ____________________________ name of Fire , Wind & Wisdom Artist Eluveitie album the early year
