fraught with so much greed , imperial need . satisfy your hunger for might and blood ! with greedy claw the eagle fly leave chaos and widow on his hunt . we do not accept to bear the half-moon on our foot nor to bow , to the laurel wreath ! " Haec terra mea est " - the urge of your own want spur the horse towards the devastating aint . it be the pauper that accrouches - bare indigence your need should cost unnumbered life ! might and rich you have seek , willing to pay the price in human life ! false and fallacious , killing and omnivorous deplete the value of human life ! but we always know : you come with fortune and one day you will come with steel ! we do not accept to bear the half-moon on our foot ! a tort that pay it wage death ? well , how do it feel , the blood on your hand ? I hope you have a ball in efface life ! well , how do it feel , the blood on your hand ? I hope the gold you have win bestow your delight ! ... stand at the top of all the ruin you have leave ... watch our wife remigrate with crooked back ... ______________________ name your Gaulish War Artist Eluveitie album the early year
