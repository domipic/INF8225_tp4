in a contented manner she sit by the bonfire sanctimoniously thank you for the hospitality her treacherous intention as cold as the occasional gust of wind kiss your back you mistake the twinkle in her eye for pure warm-heartedness , and have no premonition of their effect on you . a bleak smile flicker on her lip , she behold you with algid satisfaction , as in her sinister mind , you become her prey , her treasure , a sacrifice on the altar of her own lust . cursed and sacred , this arcane exercise , disembodied fiend wave through her gaze . be a virtuoso of deceit and facetiousness , she leave you with no chance of escape from what be happen in your mind . she have n't come to crush your bone , nor tear your flesh . she have come to steal your sanity with just one glance . ________________________________ name Sacrapos - at First Glance Artist Eluveitie album evocation @card@ - the arcane Dominion
