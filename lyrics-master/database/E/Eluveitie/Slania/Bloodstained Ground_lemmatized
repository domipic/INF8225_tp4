what do close in here ? I ca n't remember ever shed tear o'spite on this ground , crop up the fatal frontline like a soot-blackened palisade yet impel , void and abulic Legions delineate an ominous skyline as lifeless demon without soul these insentient host abide engulf war monger get away from here ! tread you the path of vast deceit ? every piece of evidence be a lie the war , the threat be a hyp fake to move figure on the board ! Stain Bibracte 's ground ! what do you see in me ? do you breathe-in dream ? what spur you to come here ? an oneiric picture of be ... like disaffected legion take , lure I wonder what lie , what threat or promise persuade them to leave their home that far away ... do they really know ? as the carnyx roar aloud I quak not , yet just ask myself how their heart take the bait , these sweeten word of bitter essence Face to face with nameless foe scorch word , unspoken lorn unheard quest remain the ash of the dead forsooth we will bear the brunt Upright in life or in death yet still the countless cry echo in silence cave of nothing _________________________ name bloodstained Ground Artist Eluveitie album Slania
