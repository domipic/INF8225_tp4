the silvern light , a stannite glow the primal night of the darken vault under the welkin dark , solemn chant will soar the immemorial , song of the wise to declare the rise of the night-born of glint dew and susurrant wind of a vibrant dawn , long foreshow and your pristine face pour down crystal ray caress by your velvet touch , as we dance through the night one last silver kiss , as the ancient song fall silent the wolf from Antumnos come bear heritage divine in stannic pearl , the light pour over the rock-grey coat of the proud your radiance crystalline , herald the ancient word resound high and clear from the Otherworld to declare the rise of the night-born in this night we dance , glory to the nameless one Atir aissom atir imon caress by your velvet touch , as we dance through the night one last silver kiss , as the ancient song fall silent one last silver kiss before the last string decay _______________________ name the silver sister Artist Eluveitie album origin
