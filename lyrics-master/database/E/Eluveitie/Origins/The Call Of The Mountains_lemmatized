against the wave with our sword in our hand against the sea with our back to the wall against distress in the presence of our enemy against the storm roar at our face a cry ring out throughout the sky a beckon , the flight of the crane the call of the mountain , ooh , ooh the call of the alp the call home , ooh , ooh the tune in our heart , the song of the mountain what be that stir , so blatant in our sally heart ? what be that urge that lift up our longing eye ? what be that ring echo from the leaden sky ? what be that augur resounding from the lyre 's string ? a cry ring on in the sibilant wind a behest , the outcry of the crane the call of the mountain , ooh , ooh the call of the alp the call home , ooh , ooh the tune in our heart , the song of the mountain the voice in the wind , the saint in the sky the call of the mountain , ooh , ooh the call of the alp the call home , ooh , ooh the tune in our heart , the call of the mountain , ooh , ooh the call of the alp the call home , ooh , ooh the tune in our heart , the song of the mountain _______________________________ name the call of the Mountains Artist Eluveitie album origin
