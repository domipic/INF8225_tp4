I be the mystery and I be the bringer of moonless night I bear the wisdom arcane I , harbringer from the burrow isle once you break forth Harken the flap of my wing I haunt your fear though you do n't know of my duty to lead your path because I will take you home to rest in my black wing , enfold you I be the icon sublime the guide of the voyage clandestine I sing the verse bewail I , torch of the radiant way once you step out hearken the stroke of my wing once you will leave your cocoon I will be there I haunt your fear though you do n't know of my duty to lead your path because I will take you home to rest in my black wing , enfold you and death will smile his barefaced smile initiate your final anguish it be not before my arrival that you will be lead to feel the natural serenity of leave this world ... hear my wing caress the wind ! hear my cry ... I haunt your fear though you do n't know of my duty to lead your path because I will take you home to rest in my black wing enfold you _____________________ name quoth the Raven Artist Eluveitie album everything Remain [ as it never be ]
