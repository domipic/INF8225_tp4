( I have get purpose once again . ) if look could kill you will be the one , that take my world and make me numb . I be nothing , without you I ca n't breathe . ( I ca n't breathe . ) and as the sunlight burn the sky , I see through my obsessive eye . I be nothing , without you I cant see . like the bright star you shine through . Ashley , baby , you make me feel so alive . I have get purpose once again . yeah , yeah . Ashley , baby , you make me feel so alive . I have get purpose once again . yeah , yeah . yeah , yeah . you be the strength i need to fight , you be the reason i still try . I be the moth and you be the light . use these wing so i can fly , I can fly . Ashley , baby , you make me feel so alive . I have get purpose once again . yeah , yeah . Ashley , baby , you make me feel so alive . I have get purpose once again . yeah , yeah . Ashley , baby , you make me feel so alive . I have get purpose once again . yeah , yeah . yeah , yeah .
