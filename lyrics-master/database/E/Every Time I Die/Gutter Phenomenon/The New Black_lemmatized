baby , you get me all wrong . and maybe , I be not all down and out I be high and I be in . do n't you know who I be ? I be the jaded one with pop insensitivity . when I finish struggle , we can make our way to the dance floor , and stand like stranger , in an elevator stick between story . I always find myself in the middle of your story . with the camera as a witness I will suffer ! if everything I do be wrong then , by God , I will do it right . we do n't dance no , no , no ... we get class ! no , we do n't have any fun at all . it be the new style and we know it ! we be not stunning , we be just stun ! we be lie for a living ! do n't you know who I be ? I be the real thing with low-key sensibility . I do n't need what I have get , half as much as everyone covet it ! well , if love me be wrong then goddamn you do it right . it turn us on to turn you down ! we be turn on to turn you down ! ___________________ name the New Black Artist every time I die album Gutter phenomenon
