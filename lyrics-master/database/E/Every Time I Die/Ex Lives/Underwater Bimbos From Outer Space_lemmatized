I want to be dead with my friend wide-eyed , brilliant , dynamic rest I want to be dead with my friend where the iron sharpen the iron I want to be dead with my friend a vulgar , loud , unforgettable end I want to be dead with my friend let boredom cease the beating of our purple heart against this , even god fight violently in vain what chance could we have stand ? we be the last of the lose , but now we be the first of the fashionably late love one decompose you will dance around the bone but most of us be wholly ghost all of us be wholly ghost we make the scene when we make a scene and though it be brief , it mean everything Oh , what a pity , now they be bind to make us saint against this , even boy fight violently in vain what chance could we have stand ? we be the last of the lose , but now we be the first of the fashionably late I refuse to be the only man put to rest in a mass grave you be all there with me ________________________________________ name underwater bimbo from Outer Space Artist every time I die album ex life
