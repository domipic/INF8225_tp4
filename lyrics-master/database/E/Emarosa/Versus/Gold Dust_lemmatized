I ai n't a ghost man you can see my foot walk on and I ai n't dead yet I be sing song so sing along and you can let em ' know I take what I be look for and you can let em ' know I take it cause ' they could n't , no I ai n't a bad man you could say that I be still my mother 's son . and I ai n't see red I be see everything I never be and you can let em ' know I take what I be look for and you can let em ' know I take it cause ' they could n't , no so where do we go from here ? I play the wrong hand on the other hand I play it right and I be take up a throne that be already ready already mine and you can let em ' know I take what I be look for and you can let em ' know I take it cause ' they could n't , no so where do we go from here ? you walk away I walk away and now that I be go be it sink in ? and now that I be home be it sink in alone ? _______________ name Gold Dust Artist Emarosa album versus
