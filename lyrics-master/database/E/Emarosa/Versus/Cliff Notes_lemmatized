this be n't war this be n't courage this be n't how you be suppose to be and all the thing keep you awake be leave me afraid this be n't war this be n't courage and I do n't believe that you be okay the reason why I forget to close my eye when you be next to me I feel you be go to leave when birthday be suicide day and wake up it be hard to stay I want to see you when you come down so save yourself for me I want to see you when you come down so save yourself the weight of love forever try and it be enough to bury me all the thing keep you awake be leave finally when birthday be suicide day and wake up it be hard to stay I want to see you when you come down so save yourself for me I want to see you when you come down so save yourself always say the same way I be okay always walk away in chain you know we wish you will come around because nothing be change but it do n't feel the same I want to see you when you come down so save yourself for me I want to see you when you come down so save yourself _________________ name Cliff Notes Artist Emarosa album versus
