nothing leave run alone everything be move fast keep pace with plane above nothing ever seem to last I be sorry you ca n't see where I be run from I hope to get away forget the way I sing the same old song but I always sing along when all be say and do on the run it be not where I want to be no , it will all remain the same if I change you will see oh my love be it ever enough ? because everybody seem to feel the same and I do n't know if I have a line a line to make you want to wait so now I be guilt stricken silent with my head on the floor and I will never be the same so to get away forget the way I play the same old song and make the same mistake when all be say and do on the run it be not where I want to be no , it will all remain the same if I change you will see me when it be do and I be learn not to love part of me go through emotion I ca n't show go through the motion of regret I let go and I be learn I be alone suddenly live in the moment you both know you be fall from the same tight rope when all be say and do on the run it be not where I want to be no , it will all remain the same if I change you will see me when it be do _____________________ name same tight rope Artist Emarosa album versus
