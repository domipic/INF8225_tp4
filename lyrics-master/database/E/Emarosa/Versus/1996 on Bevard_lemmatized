it pay to be insane Indiana rain I let go and I make the same mistake sleep in the flame I lose hope just to be alone afraid I will be my father and fade away we almost sound the same afraid I will be forget but I ca n't change I need to hear you say please do n't look away I still want to let you let me in even when it end if you need to love me love me patiently just until you see I be give up and just to make sure I have waste all doubt just to make sure please wake me up now and what wo n't let me down be my fear afraid I will be my father and fade away we almost sound the same afraid I will be forget but I ca n't change I be break and it be hurt and all you say be love me too do n't take it if you know it be not enough maybe I will be more tomorrow afraid I will be my father and fade away we almost sound the same afraid I will be forget but I ca n't change ____________________ name @card@ on Bevard Artist Emarosa album versus
