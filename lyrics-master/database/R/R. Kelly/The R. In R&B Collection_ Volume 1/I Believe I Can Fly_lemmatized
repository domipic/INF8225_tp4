I use to think that I could not go on and life be nothing but an distrustful song but now I know the meaning of true love I be lean on the everlasting arm if I can see it , then I can do it if I just believe it , there be nothing to it I believe I can fly I believe I can touch the sky I think about it every night and day spread my wing and fly away I believe I can soar I see me run through that open door I believe I can fly I believe I can fly I believe I can fly see I be on the verge of break down sometimes silence can seem so loud there be miracle in life I must achieve but first I know it start inside of me if I can see it , then I can be it if I just believe it , there be nothing to it I believe I can fly I believe I can touch the sky I think about it every night and day spread wing and fly away I believe I can soar I see me run through that open door I believe I can fly I believe I can fly I believe I can fly Hey , ' cause I believe in you Oh if I can see it , then I can do it if I just believe it , there be nothing to it I believe I can fly I believe I can touch the sky I think about it every night and day spread wing and fly away I believe i can soar I see me run through that open door I believe I can fly I believe I can fly I believe I can fly if I just spread my wing ( I can fly ) I can fly ( I can fly ) I can fly ( I can fly ) I can fly ( I can fly ) if I just spread my wing ( I can fly ) I can fly ...
