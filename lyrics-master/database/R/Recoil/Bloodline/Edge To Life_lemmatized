I be not wait for a king to rule my mind or anything I do n't need your Band of gold to take me where I need to go a simple man well he could do more but you can only see the trace that have go before there be an edge to life that will cut you like a knife when you lie your head down there be a castle of sand that get kick in your face to see how easily you will fall from grace there be a piece of dust that crumble in your hand if you decide to lose control no one can escape when you find out they be fake and you want to take the whole lot down a simple man well he could do more but you can only see the trace that have go before there be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow if you walk the white line there be a piece of dust that crumble in your hand if you decide to lose control there be a castle of sand that get kick in your face to see how easily you will fall from grace yes , there be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow there be an edge to life that will cut you like a knife when you lie your head down you know you ca n't escape when you find out they be fake and you want to take the whole lot down there be no truth in the lie that only angel cry when everybody know we be all bear to die there be an edge to life that will cut you like a knife I miss you there be no power that be such a thrill that can make a man or anything I miss you I miss you I miss you I miss you I miss you __________________ name edge to Life Artist recoil album bloodline write by Toni Halliday , Alan Wilder
