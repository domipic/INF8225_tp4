they be high on the watchtower , keep the peace ... ; whatever that mean . because you see the world grow , Crosshairs and TV , do n't you ? ten foot wall build around us , White picket death . so quiet , so safe . but if we fall there will be nothing , and no one to catch us . sit back and watch as we ... ; spin out of control , spin out of control , try to recover , but collide with each other . we spin out of control , ( Hey ! ) ( Hey ! ) ( Hey ! ) something I ca n't change , I be bear in a place , that life by the sword . and thus to it 's blade we be condemn . do n't you understand why we scream " no more . " ? ( no more ! ) my dream be of child , orphan by blood , spill at these hand . here on the grave of the innocent , we raise our flag . spin out of control , spin out of control , try to recover , but collide with each other . we spin out of control . ( hey ! ) ( Hey ! ) ( Hey ! ) some thing you do n't forgive , some thing you do n't forget . sometimes the fate you suffer be so much bad than death . we be way off course now and we be drift out to sea . so cut the anchor on your heart to be set free , set free , set free ! yeah . spin out of control , spin out of control , spin out of control , spin out of control . try to recover , we have to recover , before we crash , one after the other . spin out of control . ____________________ name Kotov syndrome artist rise against album appeal to Reason
