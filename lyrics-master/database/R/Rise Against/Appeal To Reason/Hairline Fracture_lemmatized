a sinking ship , an awkward kiss a chance to set thing straight the kind of hurt that burn and burn like fire we ca n't contain we hole up in a shelter make of bone and ice and there we will wait so start again with steady hand this time nothing get in our way but as we peer a little closer what do we see ? a crack in the surface a flaw in the plan ( plan we make together , almost bury in the sand ) a cadence imperfect like a building condemn ( can we indemnify ourselves if we do n't face what we be against ) a promise keep the dirt unswept a poorly worn disguise a child unloved that then grow up to love what we despise we be break but still breathe we be wound but we be heal we pick up right where we leave off breathe on the ash that remain so that these coal may become fire to guide our way a crack in the surface a flaw in the plan ( plan we make together , almost bury in the sand ) a cadence imperfect like a building condemn ( can we indemnify ourselves if we do n't face what we be against ) I walk on wound that seldom prove to slow me down I laugh this constant pain away so you ca n't tell but there it lie under the smile it drain me mile after mile but seldom prove to slow me down here I go ... here I go ... here I go ... should we just hold on to what remain of what we think be lose but it be just a crack in the surface a flaw in the plan ( plan we make together , almost bury in the sand ) a cadence imperfect like a building condemn ( can we indemnify ourselves if we do n't face what we be against ) a crack in the surface ... a crack in the surface ... _______________________ name hairline fracture artist rise against album appeal to Reason
