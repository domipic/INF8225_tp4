I can still remember the word and what they mean as we etch them with our finger in year of wet cement the day blur into each other though everything seem clear we cruise along at half speed but then we shift gear we run like vampire from a thousand burning sun but even then , we should have stay but we run away now all my friend be go maybe we have outgrow all the thing that we once love run away but what be we run from ? a show of hand from those in this audience of one where have they go ? identity assume us as nine and five add up synchronize watch with the second that we lose and I look up and see you I know that you see me we freeze but for a moment in empathy I bring down the sky for you , but all you do be shrug you give my emptiness a name and you run away now all my friend be go maybe we have outgrow all the thing that we once love run away but what be we run from ? a show of hand from those in this audience of one where have they go ? we be all OK , until the day we be not the surface shine , while the inside rot we race the sunset and we almost win we slam the brake , but the wheel go on and we run away now all my friend go maybe we have outgrow all the thing that we once love run away but what be we run from ? a show of hand from those in this audience of one where have they go ? _____________________ name audience of one artist rise against album appeal to Reason
