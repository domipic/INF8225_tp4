welcome home while away they have tamper with the lock and your thing they rearrange we propose , a good way say the note they leave behind in their wake of disarray you fall in place do n't fall asleep they will find us here I know a place , to disappear as a voice proclaim what we be be the sum of a thousand lie what we know be almost nothing at all but we be what we be ' til the day we die Or ' til we do n't have the strength to go on ' til we do n't have the strength to go on let us cry let us be let us open up our heart without fear of anything Faith alone be all we need to traverse this burning bridge now before it get too late you claim " it be fine " but the heart reveal what smile betray your sad sad eye give you away and do n't you know what we be be the sum of a thousand lie what we know be almost nothing at all but we be what we be ' til the day we die Or ' til we do n't have the strength to go on ' til we do n't have the strength to go on our shoulder bear an awful weight but still we trudge on just the same our color run then leave a stain they blacken our once honest name how can we argue , tell me over the fury and the fire how many time can we tell you that we be not like you , we see right through your poor disguise that fail to fool the wary eye that be train on you what we be be the sum of a thousand lie what we know be almost nothing at all but we be what we be ' til the day we die Or ' til we do n't have the strength to go on ' til we do n't have the strength to go on what we be be the sum of a thousand lie what we know be almost nothing at all but we be what we be ' til the day we die Or ' til we do n't have the strength to go on ' til we do n't have the strength to go on ___________________________ name the Strength to go on artist rise against album appeal to Reason
