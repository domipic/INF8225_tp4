to the sound of a heartbeat pound away to the rhythm of the awful rust machine we toss and turn but do n't sleep each breath we take make us thieve like cause without rebel just talk but promise nothing else we crawl on our knee for you under a sky no longer blue we sweat all day long for you but we sow seed to see us through ' Cause sometimes dream just do n't come true we wait to reap what we be due to the rhythm of a time bomb tick away and the blare of the siren comb the street chase down like dog we run from your grasp until the sun come up we crawl on our knee for you under a sky no longer blue we sweat all day long for you but we sow seed to see us through ' Cause sometimes dream just do n't come true look now at what they have do to you White needle bury in the red the engine roar and then it give but never die ' Cause we do n't live we just survive on the scrap that you throw away I wo n't crawl on my knee for you I wo n't believe the lie that hide the truth I wo n't sweat one more drop for you ' Cause we be the rust upon your gear we be the insect in your ear we crawl ... we crawl ... we crawl all over you ! we sow seed to see us through our day be precious and so few we all reap what we be due under this sky no longer blue we bring a dawn long overdue we crawl ... an ' we crawl ... an ' we crawl all over you ! __________________________________ name re-education ( through Labor ) Artist rise against album appeal to Reason
