when our river run dry and our crop cease to grow and when our summer grow longer and winter wo n't snow from the bank of the ocean and the ice in the hill to the fight in the desert where progress stand still when we have lose our will that be how we will know this be not a test , oh no this be cardiac arrest of a world too proud to admit our mistake we be crash into the ground as we all fall from grace when the air that we breathe become air that we choke when the marsh fever spread from the swamp to our home when your home on the range have be tear down and pave and the buffalo roam to a slaughterhouse grave what more will it take for us to know this be not a test , oh no this be cardiac arrest of a world too proud to admit our mistake kiss the ground as we all fall from grace this be a chance to set thing straight to bend or break the rule back into place there be no middle ground , no compromise , we have draw the line with perfect aim , we stand back and throw Glass window break and its all about to blow light go out as we pass the torch again in hope that it stay light neutrality mean that you do n't really care Cause the struggle go on even when you be not there blind and unaware ... that be how we will know this be not a test , oh no this be cardiac arrest of a world too proud to admit our mistake we be crash into the ground as we all , yeah we all , all fall from grace _____________________________ name collapse ( Post-Amerika ) Artist rise against album appeal to Reason
