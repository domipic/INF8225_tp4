far from home on a road unknown where the vulture circle on wind that blow from northern sky that haunt these wake moment on shadow cast by the mountain range on callous sole we find our way through desperate eye , we long for the horizon while this sun be rise we be the long forgotten son and daughter that do n't belong to anyone we be alone under this sun we work to fix the work that you have undo when cry for help go unanswered and signal fire just burn and burn we wonder if we be wait here for nothing ' Cause our lip be sew our ear be fill with the constant drone of the unfulfilled but we will never fall if we stand for something we stand for something we be the long forgotten son and daughter that do n't belong to anyone we be alone under this sun we work to fix the work that you have undo do n't fall , I see light in the distance they be not far away stand up because the sky be turn gray there be hope in these footstep of persistence so do n't go astray these light get closer everyday we be the long forgotten son yeah , we be the long forgotten son we be the long forgotten son and daughter that do n't belong to anyone we be alone under this sun we work to fix the work that you have undo what you have undo ( what happen now , we do n't know , just hold on tight now here we go ... ; ) _________________________ name long forget Sons Artist rise against album appeal to Reason
