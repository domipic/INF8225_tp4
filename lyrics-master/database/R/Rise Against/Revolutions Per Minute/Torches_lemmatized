on clear day I can see the light from my bedroom door on windy night I can smell the lake as it drift to me from the shore the traffic light silently change a thousand time a day but I be still wait yeah , I be still wait and if my hand could block the sun would we ever wake up ? and if I turn back all these clock would that be time enough ? I ca n't remember exactly when this longing begin but I know it be n't before the day you touch my hand laugh and shout in blissful daze and number be exchange but , I be still wait yeah , I be still wait and if my hand could block the sun would we ever wake up ? and if I turn back all these clock would that be time enough ? so put your hand where I can see them and shut your mouth I know who you be in a world void of feeling or heart I know that we be the torch in the dark let be break this down let be make this count let be leave this one-horse town no good time than now let be break this down let be make this count let be leave this one-horse town no good time than now the angel dance , like feather float they be here to see and to be see the clock strike two , the music slow and each one slowly don their wing once outside they all pair off and hand in hand they leave but I be still wait yeah , I be still wait and if my hand could block the sun would we ever wake up ? and if I turn back all these clock would that be time enough ? would we ever wake up ? _____________ name torch artist rise against album revolution per minute
