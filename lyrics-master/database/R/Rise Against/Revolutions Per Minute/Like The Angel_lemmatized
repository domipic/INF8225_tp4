they turn the light down low in shadow hide from the world only come out when it get cold the sea part when they hit the floor the voice carry on and out the door and everything you touch turn into gold like the angel you be you laugh , create a lightness in my chest your eye , they penetrate me your answer 's always ' maybe ' that be when I get up and leave a beating heart , a microphone a tick clock in an empty home still tell of these time so long ago and even though I have come so far I know I have get so far to go and any day now I will explode like the angel you be you laugh , create a lightness in my chest your eye , they penetrate me your answer 's always ' maybe ' that be when I get up and leave and each and everyday , we will lead into tomorrow tomorrow bring one less day without you but do n't wait up , just leave the light on ' Cause all the road that I might take Will all one day lead back to you and like the angel you be you laugh , create a lightness in my chest your eye , they penetrate me never cease to amaze that be when I get up and leave ____________________ name like the Angel Artist rise against album revolution per minute
