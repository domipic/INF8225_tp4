I hit the ground and I be still run but I need a place to stay tonight I swear I will be go in the morning I just need somewhere now I ca n't bear the thought of lose I dread the attention winning bring and ever since the day I come here I can stand without your string I be so sick of all these people but I be scare to be alone and if this life have teach me anything I forget it long ago and so I hit the ground and I be still run but I need a place to stay tonight I swear I will be go in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eye hit the ground and I be still run but I need a place to stay tonight I swear I will be go in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eye the heart be something you ca n't control we either choose to follow or be leave on our own so we be leave here on our less-traveled road as our desperate cry grow louder I know we be get close , get close and so I hit the ground and I be still run but I need a place to stay tonight I swear I will be go in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eye hit the ground and I be still run but I need a place to stay tonight I swear I will be go in the morning I just need somewhere warm to close my eye _______________________ name voice off Camera Artist rise against album revolution per minute
