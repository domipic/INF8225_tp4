the day I learn to fly I be never come down on perfect wing I will rise through the layer of the cloud and from there I see the neon grid of city where six million people that keep their fire light and I throw a party in my name but the hour crawl by and no one come so I bow my head and I pray for wing to take me from this place from you I see myself inside you you dream the dream that I do you be still search for these answer they be not inside your wrist and from there I see the neon grid of city where six million people that can keep their fire light and I throw a party in my name but the hour crawl by and no one come so I bow my head and I pray for wing to take me from this place from you and I close my eye as the curtain draw I think I hear your voice but I think wrong ' Cause you be not there anymore no , you be not there anymore and so I lift my chin as the show go on the sky be listen , the star all sing along but you be not there anymore and I just ca n't care anymore __________________ name heaven Knows Artist rise against album revolution per minute
