in a world of uncertainty the night sky tell us all to be patient but when the ground start shake I wonder for how long there be a place that I will rather be there be a voice deep inside of me say the progress we be make be not progress at all into a world of promise , whoa be where we let ourselves be lead we build the bridge we now sleep under we frame the door way but may not pass through the very same road that we now wander one you pass us by on we pave with our bare hand pave with our bare hand a black cloud hover over me without all this guilt I feel naked something about the way it wrap its arm around White snow cover everything an angel watch over me pray , she ask me for a favor catch me if I fall a rush of blood straight to the head , whoa I wonder what this could have be we build the bridge we now sleep under we frame the door way but may not pass through the very same road that we now wander one you pass us by on we pave with our bare hand pave with our bare hand Hey ! no I never mean to hurt you no I never mean to do you wrong I stand wait while the man say move along we lie the track down but now they rot like a runaway train we brace for the crash we be in love once have you forget ? like a runaway train bear down upon a gap we build the bridge ( brace for the crash ) ( build from their hypocrisy ) we build the bridge ( brace for the crash ) ( and now we brace for the crash ) we build the bridge ( brace for the crash ) ( build from their hypocrisy ) we build the bridge ( brace for the crash ) and underneath the shadow we now live _____________ name Bridges Artist rise against album the Black Market
