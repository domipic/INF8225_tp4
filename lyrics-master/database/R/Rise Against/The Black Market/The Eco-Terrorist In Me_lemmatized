spray paint the camera , jam the frequency , what you kill , just come alive in me , hood and bandana make not an enemy , you ca n't define us , any way you please ! you make the rule , we make the call my conscience clean , my sin absolve because I find God ( hey ! ) in the sound of your factory burn down , now I sleep so sound ... when it all come down , will you say you do everything you could ? when it all come down , can you say that you never give up ? be you stand by to watch it fall away ? will you hold on or let go ? instead of do what be right they build high wall where we ca n't shed a light on true criminal when business and suffering be one and the same when law fail the people , they turn to the flame I find love ( love ! ) I find life ( life ! ) as a thorn stick in your side , and you wonder why ... when it all come down , will you say you do everything you could ? when it all come down , can you say that you never give up ? be you stand by , to watch it fall away ? will you hold up ? do you hold up ? or just let it fall ? do you let it fall ? when it all come down , will you say you do everything you could ? when it all come down , can you say that you never give up ? when it all come down , will you say you do everything you could ? when it all come down , when it all come down ... when the light all go out , and roadblock go up , as we sleep to the sound of alarm go off when it all come down , will you say you do everything you could ? _____________________________ name the Eco-Terrorist in Me Artist rise against album the Black Market
