I watch the rise and the fall of the common man I live to see all our step walk back I watch the wall all crash down crumble just to be rebuild while we sleep we throw sword in the ocean wide and deep we promise peace but the peace wo n't last because now we forge new blade so nervously wait for this harmony to pass I stand guard and roam like a sentinel and I see it all I have be awake too long Wish there be something that could close my eye to all that I see awake too long , it would be easy to fall asleep we fall in love but the love keep run out we follow road but the road all end we live and learn and learn to live without Falling from the ladder we ascend I have see the eye of the widow leave behind I have see the child of a fall man and never once do our leader apologize for battle they begin can n't look away or pretend not to see and so I stay I have be awake too long Wish there be something that could close my eye to all that I see awake too long , it would be easy to fall asleep , asleep maybe I would dream if I could sleep maybe I will see what this could be instead of what it be be there bliss in ignorance be this our demise we ca n't prevent should we fall asleep ? I have be awake too long I have be awake too long I have be awake too long I have be awake too long ( I have be awake too long ) and like constant vigil ( I have be awake too long ) we be burn eternal flame ( I have be awake too long ) a surgery , blade in an open heart ( I have be awake too long ) and through it all , it all every single cut , I have be awake ____________________ name awake too long artist rise against album the Black Market
