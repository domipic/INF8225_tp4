float in the cloud , I be give up the fight a voice be call out , I be walk into the light we use to race a thousand mile a day so fast foot they barely even touch the ground we use to fly to place out beyond our own little world the fury and the sound I see it flicker like a television set bright flash of a warn sign flip channel in a world go static erode away line by fade line underwater for year we find so much hard to swim than drown the current take us now we be walk into the light be you die all your life ? ( walk into the light ) Broken , beat , and tire out ( walking into the light ) you want to live but do n't know how ( walking into the light ) diagnosis : sudden life ( walk into the light ) can no one revive me now ? feel like I be walk into the light wake up float on a wave of golden sound tunnel vision and a great beyond Heart beating like a rhythm slow down til it have go an echo of a song flat line and a close bell whisper a warm farewell the flame be beckon as we be walk into the light be you die all your life ?

I see light up ahead and hear choir of angel ring in my ear but you know that have you a choice you would go back do it again we all have unfinished business to tend so no I wo n't go gentle into that good night you can keep your candle I be walk away from the light yeah , I be walk away from the light I be walk away from the light I be walk away from the light now I be walk away from the light diagnosis : sudden life ( walk away from the light ) I wake up my heart racing ( walk away from the light ) I be at a loss explain why ( walk away from the light ) be you die all your life ( walk away from the light ) then put your dark day behind let life flash right before your eye and for the very first time it feel like I be walk away from the light _________________ name sudden Life Artist rise against album the Black Market
