My God be good than yours and the wall of my house be so thick I hear nothing at all I follow you out in the storm but it carry you off and I burn every picture of yours be that not enough ? my gun be big than yours so let be arm the mass and see what the bastard do then walk tall once set us apart now we be down on all four do you cry my name in the dark like I do yours ? these storm be get strong now truss all bend and sway Lightning hit , the power go out in the fray as the wave crash high and the shoreline disappear I will scream to the sky " Hey , people live here . " my dream be not unlike yours they long for the safety and break like a glass chandelier but there be laughter and oh there be love just past the edge of our fear and there be chaos when push come to shove but it be music to my ear may you be in heaven before the devil know you be dead May these wind be always at your back ' Cause when we be all just ghost and the madness overtake us we will look at the ash and say , " People live here . " from the penthouse to the holy martyr Sea to shine sea from the coffin full of kindergartner be this what you call free ? from the hate that drip from all your crosse be your hand so clean ? and the wildfire and it be spread far from sea to shine sea when we be all just ghost and the madness overtake us I will scream to the sky yeah I will scream to the sky yeah I will scream to the sky " Hey , people live here .
