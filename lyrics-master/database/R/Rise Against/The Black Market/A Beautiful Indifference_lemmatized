there be a struggle come , but to conquer , first they must divide the machine keep hum night and day how be we so unaware why be you not afraid ? protest be drum while you turn your nose and roll your eye knee-jerk reaction so ingrain judge from an arm chair Cause there be hate and there be love and there be loss but there be light and there be dark , then there be us and whether this world burn , be none of your concern catch up in a ticker-tape parade I have learn to stand up and just to walk away sometimes the cold heart be n't worth the love or the hate Learn to let go , learn to walk away up from the shadow I be seduce by the light of the flame but this time I be here to stay gunpowder residue , bright light and turpentine true color shine through , as we be strip of our exterior now , cause there be hate and there be love and there be loss but there be right and there be wrong , then there be us we be fall until we learn to stand up and just to walk away sometimes the cold heart be n't worth the love or the hate Learn to let go , learn to walk away up from the shadow I be seduce by the light of the flame but this time I be here to stay foot first into the quicksand , every day we be surrender never stray from the game plan I keep hope you will take my hand and stand up the water be overflow , the wall be break but I know where I be go , that we can make it and there be a light still glowing and I will chase it and I have be lose before and I have be lead astray but this time I be here to stay ______________________________ name a beautiful indifference artist rise against album the Black Market
