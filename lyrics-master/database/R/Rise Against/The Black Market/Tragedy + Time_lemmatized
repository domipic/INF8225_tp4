on the edge of the sharp knife in the middle of the dark night always know that I would find you here in a puddle of the brave tear I have see enough to know it be lonely where you be above the crowd foot dangle from a rooftop ( a rooftop ) she wait from ledge for a voice to talk her down nothing matter but the pain when you be alone never-end night when you be awake when you be pray that tomorrow it be okay there will be a time to crack another smile maybe not today or for a while but we be hold on to laugh again some day to laugh again some day all that matter be the time we have do n't matter how it all go bad never wonder what it might be like shut the door , say goodbye when face with tragedy we come alive or come undone so do n't hold back , let it shape you like an ocean even the deep scar in time will fade nothing matter but the pain when you be alone never-end night when you be awake when you be pray that tomorrow it be okay there will be a time to crack another smile maybe not today or for a while but we be hold on to laugh again some day yeah , we be hold on to laugh again some day and sometimes you have to go back to know just where you be then but we be old enough to know that what have be , will be again and again and the brave of face be the one where we fake it and the role that we play nothing matter when the pain be all but go when you be finally awake despite the overwhelming odd , tomorrow come and when they see you crack a smile and you decide to stay a while you will be ready then , to laugh again nothing matter but the pain ( we be tragedy , yeah , we be sympathy ) nothing matter but the pain you see what you want to see nothing matter but the pain ( we be misery , a distant memory ) nothing matter but the pain we all learn to laugh again yeah , we all learn to laugh again we all learn to laugh again ____________________ name tragedy + Time Artist rise against album the Black Market
