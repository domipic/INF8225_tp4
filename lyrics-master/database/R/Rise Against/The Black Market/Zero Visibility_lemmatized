settle in here for the long haul can n't hide forever be what they say in with the wind , out with a bang meanwhile nothing have change with each word slowly utter a storm brew in her eye a miss shot at the buzzard time , whether waste or well-spent , be still time we be not brave , we be not wise we stand at the end of the long line but we stand here all together we have be damn , we have survive we come back to home we do n't recognize but we return here all together moment of clarity here be short-lived bleed through the bandage again when be a lie no longer white but black as a day without sun pass out in a gutter wake up in your arm nurse back and recover the same touch that heal me leave a scar we be not brave , we be not wise we stand at the end of the long line but we stand here all together we have be damn , we have survive we come back to home we do n't recognize but we return here all together and the world work in way that I never have claim to know we get out in front of the weather but it follow the view from here be n't well but it be all we know it be all we know we be not brave , we be not wise we stand at the edge of the border line but we stand here all together we have be damn , we have survive who we have become you wo n't recognize but we become them all together all together _____________________ name Zero visibility artist rise against album the Black Market
