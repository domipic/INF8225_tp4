I accept the subtle invitation in your beautiful green eye and press an ear to your ruby red lip ... " it be come to get me " , you whisper . a button on your dress release itself and the garment drop to the floor . the fussy eunoch have fumble to cover your exposed shoulder but you could n't reach ... " look ... it want to kill me ! " understate , yet petrify ... you be appeal to my good side although the devil in me ache for satisfaction . I dash to the elevator ... press the arrow and wait . on my 13th floor balcony in this hollow hotel I spy on the lobby below . there be pandemonium . gun be train ... cop in corner . cop in visor ... line of shield ... and I swear I catch the eye of the beast . wrong . as my would-be adversory turn from the counter , a dart fly into his forehead . the gun rattle ... the line of shield part . there be a distortion of spice like a ball of congeal air roll at a massive speed ... scatter body as it squeeze through the gap in the closed elevator door . and I turn to watch the illuminate number descend ... 1 ... @card@ ... @card@ ... @card@ ... so slow it must grow angry by the second ... @card@ ... @card@ ... @card@ ... " it be come to get me " , you whisper ... but what the hell could I do about it ? I wake up . I be sorry . and the radio at my bedside spit out the ever-worsening replaced-url <repurl text="news:" /> Satan be in the White House ! react . Reboot to the sound of a violent fart at a pretentious dinner party . let it pass . I want to wake up again . I could n't save you , my lovely . I can save myself . it be come to get me ... ________________________ name 15th Shade Artist cEvin Key album tHe ghost oF eAch room
