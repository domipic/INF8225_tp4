empty your glass it be time to make love last , come on keep your faith something to make you safe come on ( come on ) hold yourself save yourself from harm hold yourself save yourself from harm until you rise above this thing that we call love Flying away all you feel be pain that stays , come on try to play a game of love or hate come on ( come on ) hold yourself save yourself from harm hold yourself save yourself from harm until you rise above this thing that we call love _________________ name empty Glass Artist crying Vessel album a beautiful curse
