I live with the awareness of my own seclusion . existence fuel by separation , a war I will not win . embrace only alienation . to suffer be to abandon the only home I have ever have . outlier . I do n't belong here . the present state of existence act as a refuge for the weak . to shield our eye be to blind mankind . refusal to secede . inhabit a world of filth which other have condemn . we wo n't live our life for them . human hatred be my second nature . this be the root of my isolation . I be what I be , and I be an outcast . do n't look for me in the cloud , when I be beneath you . nowhere to be find . submerge in apathy , it be just become hard to care , and I be nothing . I have grow sick of the sound of my heartbeat . and while the whole world breathe in unison . my lung be my shield , to reject the world around me . I be what I be , and I be an outcast . _____________ name outlier artist counterpart album the difference between hell and home
