bear of two ; raise by four . I guess I take it all for grant , and only three remain . even though you be wound , I know that you be still here . I do n't blame you , you just ca n't face the change . we spend our golden year as live ghost . catch in a constant state of purgatory . we be only burden by our memory until the day they cease to exist , and we follow shortly after . although I wonder if at any time , our mind fall upon the same plane . I know they do , I just wish I have a chance to go back and appreciate it . but we will always have the winter , and the snow that get trap behind the glass . you may be only a shell of the man that you use to be , but I love you just the same , and I will until the day you be go . I just never know if I be communicate with you or the disease . and even though I curse the idea of an afterlife , I still hope you be take care of . you deserve to be at peace . please do n't forget my face . I wo n't forget to remember you . ___________ name ghost artist counterpart album the difference between hell and home
