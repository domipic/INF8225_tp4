I be more than familiar with feel empty . the conduit ; I allow myself to drain . my mind be the trench in which I will be bury . watch me wither away . put me out of my misery . I can only find solace in sleep , a sub-conscious sanctuary , I be long to be set free . yet I be the one who hold the key . I be the one who hold the key . a lifetime spend try to place the blame on anyone or anything . this be not who I be . I be not who I use to be . set me free ! set me free ! set me free ! ____________ name wither Artist counterpart album the difference between hell and home
