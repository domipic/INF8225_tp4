the grave welcome you with open arm . last light escape , last breath remain . circle the body , brush pass the skin and bone . it cradle you , your holy manger . bear into ruin , we feel withdrawal . death be your procreator , your predecessor . from your decay grow a beautiful garden , the stalk caress your failure , and the petal bring you close to eternity . pray for your rebirth . pray for your chance to bloom . the heart start and stop , the mind disconnect . as flower , we grace the earth with our presence . the tide rise and turn , and we simply expire . Over-saturated , our lung fill with the essence of the universe . until we feel the gentle kiss of dawn draw the water from our lung , and we can breathe easy . like night and day , we have never meet . ache for one another , we aim for congregation . you be my prey , you be the martyr . the blight take it be toll and our body grow black . wilt , we fade away . rot from the root , we exchange our stem for leg . we blossom into our body , and the process have be reset . welcome to your new home . ___________ name decay artist counterpart album the difference between hell and home
