everything end , at least that be what we hope for . plague by our past and we be doom to repeat ourselves . afraid of the thought that dance in revolution , and circle the mind like a snare : bind me , I be just try to feel something . cold and stale , search for warmth inside of every promise waste . you wrap yourself around me , but I can only sense your presence . you be nothing but a carcass . I have never feel more alone than I do on those night I spend watch you sleep . you be the furthest thing from me , and you have be there from the start . an empty shell , you be vacant and it scare me to death . one by one , I watch them leave me behind like live debris . fortunately , I know that I be not worth it . because in my pure form , I be never good enough for anyone . why do I think that this time it will be different ? I come bear only the beat of my heart and the good of my intention . I try by hard but I could n't make you feel a fuck thing . ____________ name debris artist counterpart album the difference between hell and home
