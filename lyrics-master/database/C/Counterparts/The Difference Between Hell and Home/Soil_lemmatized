tragedy be all we have in common , and at time we allow it to swallow us whole . draw the marrow from our misfortune to ignite the fire that be inside , inhale the smoke from the burn that leave you breathless . breathe life into the lifeless , drag them into the sun and expose them as apparition . but be there dignity in live as an entity ? " you could have make history , and we be already forget about you . " humanity be poison , and we be lose without a cure . so stop your heart and start the healing process . I be not fit to walk among you , but I do n't want to end my life . and just know that if I know of any common ground , I will leave here now , and when I get there I would build a home that I could die in . just to say I try to rest in peace . erase me from your memory . the one we love will let us down , and the rat will feed off of our failure . eventually , this be something that we must accept . the world move on without us . we leave only footprint that fade away in time . we leave our spirit to retrace our step . walk with fire , and save yourself from vagrancy . you be your memorial , find your mark and make it . the soil be the last thing we ingest , we watch our ashes scatter . you be your memorial , find your mark and make it . __________ name soil artist counterpart album the difference between hell and home
