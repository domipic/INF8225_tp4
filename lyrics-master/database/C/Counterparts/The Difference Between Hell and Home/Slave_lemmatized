if I allow the light to leave my eye , I will never see again . the thought disintegrate into cognitive pollution . abandon my body , renounce my existence . show me the meaning of happiness . trap inside this nightmare , but I have n't sleep for day . I be a slave , a slave to what I can see . be we be string along or be we just string out ? the quest to be clairvoyant : you be your own black hole . how much longer do I really have when I wish every breath would be my last ? your word like rope , tie around my throat . remove the earth beneath me . watch my spirit sink . ___________ name slave artist counterpart album the difference between hell and home
