we ache to be transparent . we run from the " open " arm ; the facade of something great than ourselves . and we be leave to coexist with infestation . our history be curse : through the past , present and future . if they be create in his image , then his image be disgust ... ; and even he ca n't wipe you clean . how can someone see so far ahead , while they be spend every day on their knee ? be the view from above really worth the judgement pass ? the fear , the lie , and the manipulation ? a doctrine bath in ignorance , and write in the blood of the enslave . and I have never lose my faith , I just never have any to begin with . I would sooner die for my sin , then pray for my forgiveness . sew my palm together , and crucify the thought in my mind . await Armageddon . neglect to exercise the demon in your head . you be " bear again , " but you be good off dead . conversion or a casualty , renounce and save yourself . be the view from heaven really worth all of the judgement pass ? the pestilence that you have inflict , and the soul of all the love one be we have lose ? we be the sheep that rise against the shepherd , we be the one you lead astray . embrace the light in your heart , not the one in the sky . saint and sinner rejoice , we will all rot together . ____________ name curse Artist counterpart album the difference between hell and home
