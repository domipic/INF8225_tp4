the weight come and go and take my will to live . spoil by defeat , force to drown in what be leave of me . that be when breathing become routine , and I could feel myself fading . strand . no direction , I be a compass . constantly spinning . constantly search for the end . never reach our destination . but the goal be never when , or where , or who ... ; it be only you . I appear in your arm as if I have be bear there . you promise you will never let me go . but I do n't know what to believe anymore . affection allow me to let the light in , the fear make me whole again . help me rebuild my break bone . help me regain my sanity . but with caution always present , our past manifest themselves . and we act as if this be what we deserve . but I refuse to fail again . I will force my ghost to write your name in the flower on my grave . I watch the world give up on me . I use to spend my night pray for air in my bloodstream , now i long to feel your breath pass through my artery . the goal be never when , or where , or who ... ; it be only you . I appear in your arm as if I have be bear there . you promise you will never let me go . but I do n't know what to believe anymore . fill me with your faith and let me leave . I be scratch at my skin to take my mind off the absence we have create . the line blur together like the vein in my arm . and I wish I be n't so alone , you be the difference between hell and home . _____________ name compass artist counterpart album the difference between hell and home
