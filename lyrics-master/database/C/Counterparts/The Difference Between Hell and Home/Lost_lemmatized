as far back as I can remember , the failure be always there . it be the only real companion that I have ever have . not mean to live like this . consciousness be nothing more than a vicious cycle , and I be be bleed dry by my conviction . I have spend my life try to find my confidence , and find absolutely nothing . Life be a lost cause . too weak to carry on . I wish I have never meet who I once be . not mean to live like this . pursue the love in all that I have lose , but I have leave myself neglect , desert from the start . longing for a chance to wander ; a chance to chase my aspiration . when you be devoid of feeling , you just do as your tell . hatred be exhausting , but it be all I will ever know . __________ name lose Artist counterpart album the difference between hell and home
