expose me for all that I be . the man behind the masquerade , I be my own false witness . fact reside solely in the depth of my mind ... ; and will I ever really let it come to surface ? you only see what I want you to see , and you believe all that you be tell . Serenity be a beautiful hoax . a liar . I have the whole world convince of my contentment . no truth in this . I have lose count of all the time I make it home alive ... ; and wish I have n't . expose me for all that I be . the man behind the masquerade , I be my phone false witness . I be leave to conquer the mountain in my mind , and I be my maker . life be what be kill me . I hate the fact that I be just fine . forever seek something to take responsibility . life be what be kill me . I hate the fact that I be alive . forever search for my scapegoat because I refuse to face reality . at least I can say I try , to cherish every single day where I wake up and do n't want to die . I will work my hand down to the bone try to stay suspend in those specific second . but I know I will just be count down the minute until I be miserable again . _____________ name Witness Artist counterpart album the difference between hell and home
