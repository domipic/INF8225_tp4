face every morning sun with a sense of resentment and a lack of admiration for everything and everyone that I have come in contact with . I ca n't hold back the truth when this have become the extent of my existence . I witness a change with my own eye , I do nothing to stop this . _______________________ name the reflex Tester Artist counterpart album prophet
