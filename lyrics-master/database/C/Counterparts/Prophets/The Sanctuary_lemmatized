we be now root in the ground that we be bear into and this be where we come from , where we will remain . this place may have its ' flaw , but I can always call the pavement we now stand upon ' my home ' . this be our home . through both the area of wealth and poverty , I appreciate every inch of our city . and I do n't know if I could ever leave . our sanctuary , our stomping ground , our territory , our fuck home . love where you come from , this be your home . this be my home . ___________________ name the sanctuary artist counterpart album prophet
