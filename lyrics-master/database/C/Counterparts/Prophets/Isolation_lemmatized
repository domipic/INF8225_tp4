the good news I have ever hear be when you say you would n't leave because I know the distance would tear us apart . and all the thing you say , would n't mean a thing if you be n't here with me . so as you turn your back to me , I just want to let you know that I could never do this to you . this be where our road divide and they split in two , and I will never see you again . but I respect your choice . the familiar pain set in again , but I ca n't let this drag me down . it be thing like this that make me who I be today . it be thing like this that help to shape / make me who I be today , it be every hardship that I have face . and I have lose hope in myself , but I just want you to know : as everyday go by , I must accept that you be now live your own life . _______________ name isolation artist counterpart album prophet
