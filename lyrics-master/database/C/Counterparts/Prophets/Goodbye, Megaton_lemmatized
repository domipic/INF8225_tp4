our city lie in ruin and our livelihood be next leave to build from decay with the whole world crash down around you . " how the fuck could we let this happen ? " and no answer come to mind . we be catch in a steady decline and there be no deterrent . oh , the aftermath could bring you to your knee . guilt be start to dissolve you from the inside out . and you be grasp at your last chance for salvation , and it be on its way . this be our own world , and its up to us to decide our own fate . and even though change may be unavoidable , it be up to us to emerge from the bottom of the barrel . as a whole , we can impact mankind for the well . and the earlier we realize this , he sooner we can reassemble our life , we reassemble our life . now be our chance to rebuild ! now be our chance to rebuild ! now be our chance to rebuild ! ______________________ name goodbye , megaton artist counterpart album prophet
