the sense of insignificance it wind itself around your chest . surrender and submission have now become what it take to be alive . just keep in mind this happen to the good of us at time , and it be not go to get any easy . you walk this road of desolation , only to end up on your knee , but just know that you be not alone . the only thing hold you back be the lie that you refuse to challenge . you be drown in a sea of self destruction , and your lung be start to cave in . and when you feel that your word can only be hear in echo , they be more deafen than ever before . every day we face help build the strength that make us who we be . I have live through this , and so can you . suffer in silence have become something throw to our past . and though the friendship that we have build be constantly fall apart , the remain few retain the most heart . and I will give you my heart . _______________ name Dark Ages Artist counterpart album prophet
