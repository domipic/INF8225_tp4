to quote from Whitman " O me ! O life ! ... of the question of these recur ; of the endless train of the faithless of city fill have with the foolish ; what good amid these , O me , O life ? answer . that you be here that life exist , and identity ; that the powerful play go on , and you will contribute a verse . that the powerful play go on , and you will contribute a verse . what will your verse be ? ________________ name Carpe Diem Artist counterpart album prophet
