our once-solid path be start to diverge and the space between us grow ever great make it hard for me to breathe . but no amount of distance can change my feeling for you . how can it be that a day I have always dream of , could also be a day that I wish would never come ? and we be slowly become two very different people , but I wo n't give you up without a fight . this be everything I have ever mean to say to you . you could be thousand of mile away , but I will still see you when I close my eye . we have come too far to let our story end like this , and we have come too far to let what we have build fall apart . we both know this be love . I will never forget you . ________________ name digression artist counterpart album prophet
