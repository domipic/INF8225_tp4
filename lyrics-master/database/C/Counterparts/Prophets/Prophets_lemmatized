other may tell you how to live but I can assure that your life be in your own hand . and you can mold it into any shape you want . though you must have faith while you be search for the answer that we be all long for . and we be leave to salvage for our aspiration . be what you want to be , and leave the rest behind you . anyone can follow blindly , but it be up to you to rise above the mass , and chase your dream , because they will soon become reality . you can lead us from our path , as we be weigh down by our ambition . and all the force in the world can make us falter . we be all prophet in the making , and our legacy be begin to unfold . I will not go to my grave yearning for what " could have be . " I know exactly who I be , and i know exactly what I will become . ______________ name prophet Artist counterpart album prophet
