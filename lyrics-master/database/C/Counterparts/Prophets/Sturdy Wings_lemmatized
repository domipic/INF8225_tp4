everything we be today stem from the marrow of our back bone this be dedication at its fine , and we owe everything that we have to you , our drive force , cause us to constantly better ourselves . we be redefin the meaning of contentment . and though the odd be against us , we all know that we will prevail . we will prevail . accept all the negativity and turn it into fuel for the flame that we keep burning on the inside . burn from the inside-out . consider this a thank you , for help us to mold our future self . and your word alone be not enough to destroy our commitment . this be where i belong . this where we belong . __________________ name Sturdy Wings Artist counterpart album prophet
