every fuck day , I have to deal with the pressure I put on myself , to outdo myself . but I ca n't ask for help , I ca n't admit I be weak . I be go back on my word , I be go back on who I use to be . I ca n't take it anymore . every day I wage a war on myself because I will rather die than let this win over me . I ca n't let this win over me . how can I be expect to help anyone else , when I ca n't even help myself ? call me a hypocrite and I will be the first one to agree . I be no longer the prophet I once claim to be . I be stick between try to find where I stand , and what it be I stand for . I be no one . _________________ name I be no one Artist counterpart album the current Will Carry U
