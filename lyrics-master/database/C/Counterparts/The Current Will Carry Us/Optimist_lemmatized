I never ask for anyone to listen , and I never ask for anyone to take my word to heart . I have let myself become a target base on nothing more than expression . I will not lie to other , and I wo n't lie to myself . if you be search for safety you can find it somewhere else , and I wo n't mind . I have never see myself as optimistic , so this should come as no surprise . no one feel good forever . not even me . but this do n't give us an excuse to allow ourselves to become useless like the rest . we will turn our hatred into something to be proud of . we will make life worth living . ______________ name optimist artist counterpart album the current Will Carry U
