all of our life we have be tell what to believe . " nothing be perfect " so what be the point of purpose ? the line that separate the weak from us who truly care , be one I do n't intend to cross . the heart of man beat but only in greedy hand , and it seem that most be still content . where most be comfortable accept insignificance , we strive to find the effort within . if you open up your eye , and open up your mind you will be expose to a world as Cold as those who be leave to populate it . two decade spend swallow lie after lie have spark a fire in my heart , and the time have come to spread the flame . we ca n't continue waste time , day after day try to find a new means of escape . we do this day after day . and I ca n't face the disconnect . I will shed the dead weight and rise . I never think that I would need to justify a reason to continue in this life I lead . I fuck hate the world , I fuck hate myself . I fuck swear I will never feel like this . ____________________ name the disconnect Artist counterpart album the current Will Carry U
