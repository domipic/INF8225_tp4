I be look back on those I once look up to , and I ca n't help but feel that I be look down . everyone I have ever admire have leave me with nothing . not even a memory . I remember grow up , and yearn to be just like you . it pain me to admit that I hold you in such a high regard , as if my life would mean nothing without your approval . but now I see the error of my way . all that time spend search for myself in someone else . I think it be safe to say that I have become everything I want to be . and no one can take that from me . all of my hero have fail me , but I wo n't ever fail myself . I ca n't believe how naive I use to be when I never really need anyone . all of my hero have fail me , but I wo n't ever fail myself . ______________ name pedestal artist counterpart album the current Will Carry U
