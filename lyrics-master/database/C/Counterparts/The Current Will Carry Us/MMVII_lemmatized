why do I need to justify my opinion , after all that I have see and do ? and year after year , we give our everything to get nothing in return . the time have come for thing to change . we do n't need your adoration , but we demand your respect . I will not allow anyone the opportunity to deny half a decade of labor . the place we have be , the face we have see , the month spend far from home . this be what move us . this be what we have grow accustom to . what we will leave behind can not be measure in a dollar figure . there be a much deep meaning than that . I ca n't wait until the day when we have surpass everything that give you a false sense of importance . I want you to question yourself . I want you to watch you slip away . I want you to realize that your existence have mean nothing . I hate you more than you could ever fuck know . and I hate you for make me feel like this . I know deep down that I be a good person , but my patience be wear thin . the good retaliation I can think of , would be to let you know that for once in my life , I be truly happy . I be more than content with who and where I be . your oppression have have no effect . I do n't need to justify my opinion after everything we have be through . and year after year , we give our everything and what we receive in return , I ca n't explain with word . I be so fuck thankful that I make it to where I be today . ( I watch the world upon your shoulder , and from these height it be so far down . ) ___________ name MMVII Artist counterpart album the current Will Carry U
