I have never tell this to anyone . I have just try to move past . but lately it seem that my insecurity have get the good of me . and I be no longer in control . no one should ever have to feel like this . to feel like me . even though the good I have outweigh the bad , the bad be what be leave me with sleepless night . I spend most of my time argue with my own reflection . for no apparent reason . and it may seem as if I have all the answer , but I be just as lose as you . I have spend the past few year try to overcome my own misery , but these sort of thing take time , and I be run out of mine . so I will pray to a God that be n't there , to a world that do n't hear , to anyone who will listen , to keep me from become everything I promise myself that I would never be . I do not deserve this . ________________ name reflection artist counterpart album the current Will Carry U
