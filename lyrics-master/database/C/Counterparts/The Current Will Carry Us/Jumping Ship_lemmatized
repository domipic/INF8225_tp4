as time pass by I feel everything change but me I will not feel the sting of defeat I have watch day become month become year and I have lose all faith in progression I will never allow myself to exchange all my moral for acceptance if this be truly where I belong I will fuck be here until the end of time I have watch everyone around me jump ship and I hope they be leave to sink the current will carry us I be proud of all that I have become and I be well aware that I have steer myself in the right direction and life be your be to destroy I just ca n't respect your decision I would rather isolate myself than be a walk definition of travesty I watch you do away with everything I would love nothing more than to watch this world swallow you whole you be the catalyst for your downfall but where the rest have fail we be bind to succeed and mark my fuck word as long as we be breathe we will overcome the integrity that we emanate day-to-day be unparalleled and our effort will not go unnoticed we will be remember __________________ name jump Ship Artist counterpart album the current Will Carry U
