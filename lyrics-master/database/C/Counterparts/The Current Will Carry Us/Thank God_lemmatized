I want to thank you for never be there . your absence have force me to find my own way . while other be lead through life with a blindfold , I can see clearly , the rain will wash me away . I reject the thought of a god when all we see be the work of an ill-fated world . I reject a liar 's cross . who be I to say what I believe be right for the mass ? I just know it be right for me . for this I have secure my place in hell , but every day I face be my own heaven in the making . what do you believe in ? what do you think be right ? century have pass , the voice of reason be still be suppress . Salvation dance in front of their face , but they be too blind to see . I reject the thought of a God , when all we see be the work of an ill-fated world . I reject a liar 's cross . thank you for never be there . thank God for never be there . _______________ name thank God Artist counterpart album the current Will Carry U
