I will graciously accept that my life 's work , whether it be in the past , the present , or the future will be overshadow by those around me with a different definition of " success . " though I ca n't explain the path I have Chosen , all I know be I be right where I need to be . and though I have turn down a chance at fame and fortune , I know that there be no great payment than this . and I be so fuck far from the life I be suppose to lead , and the man I be suppose to be and I could n't be happy . and I will remain a constant , I know where I stand , and I refuse to let their selfishness take control of who I be . while I may die poor , at least my life have meaning , there be more to life than living , and I truly feel alive . and I know that when I die , there will be other who feel the same way ready to take my place . this be our song of protest . I promise you that nothing be slow us down . while I may die poor , at least my life have meaning , there be more to life than live and I truly feel alive . and I know that when I die , there will be other who feel the same way ready to take my place . I will laugh in the face of those who tell me different . even with both of my foot plant firmly on the ground , I be free to move in my own direction . I will remain a constant . I know where I stand . __________________ name the Constant Artist counterpart album the current Will Carry U
