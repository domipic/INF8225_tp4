this be the only thing I have worth holding onto I have condense my past to fit the line on the page that no one will ever see but still I fight day after day ' cause this be all I have ever want my life to be and I push everything I’ve ever love away to keep myself from sink to keep myself from sink to keep myself from sink if I find the bad in everything , I can never be attach I’m try to find a balance I’m try to find a way but every choice I’ve ever make bring me anywhere but home but I’ve welcome sacrifice with open arm and I will never regret my decision this be the only thing that make me feel alive make me feel alive I’ve simply be search for the right place to rest my head I’m search for common ground between all that I be and all that you need me to be I’ve see a future and want nothing to do with it a constant campaign to impress those who never ever care I’m struggle but I won’t allow myself to sink you know where to find me I keep my composure and assume my place , in front of those who I love most You’re the reason why we’re here I’m struggle , but I won’t allow myself to sink I’m struggle , but I won’t allow myself to sink _____________ name sink Artist counterpart album the current Will Carry U
