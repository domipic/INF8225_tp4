though I look forward to my future , just know I be scare to death . after all be say and do , I wo n't have a clue what to do next . will I struggle to find the answer ? will I take an easy way out ? or will I find the strength inside to carry on ? my great fear be amount to nothing . I fuck hate the fact that I feel no sense of security . but more importantly , I hate the fact that I ca n't confide in myself . it feel like nothing good will stay , unless I stay the same . I need to find a way to dissolve the uncertainty . this be who I be , and this be who I will always be . I refuse to be afraid , of something I do n't know to be true . I need to pick myself back up , I need to find a way to keep all the worry from head . before it send me to an early grave . I refuse to let fear define me . _________________ name uncertainty artist counterpart album the current Will Carry U
