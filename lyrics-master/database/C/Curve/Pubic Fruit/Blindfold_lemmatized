you well believe it ( hey yeah ) you better believe it ( hey yeah ) you better believe it ( hey yeah ) you better believe it ( hey yeah ) in a conversation , talk of nothing we be drink sweet wine comfort our one and only in our sterile business we have become jealous satisfy with our desolation , wrap in our vivid dream now I remember two day that mean a lot to me I remember the two day where every hour be a day and every minute be a lifetime and the ocean be a sea and you drag me into the mountain on a flimsy guarantee the strong the man the strong the woman if it end now would you be willing ? I have give you everything I have give you nothing I use to think of angel but that be all go I use to dream of love and kiss want to belong and I tear around the corner blindfold to the world I use to think that candyfloss be only make for girl see how it feel for me ? do you believe in me ? hard-headed sense of failure in a narrow mind I never use to think about the hurt I have leave behind and now it fall upon me like winter snow and I turn the same corner when there be no place leave to go the strong the man the strong the woman if it end now would you be willing ? do you believe in me ? ( this be my own private hour ) ( this be my own private hour ) see how it feel for me ? could you love me ? could you love me ? could you love me ? could you love me ?
