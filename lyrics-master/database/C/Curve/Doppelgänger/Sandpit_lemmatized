be we savage , bear without hope last on these highway , exist to go ? swallow my pride , gut me from the inside , leave me in this pool of doubt , now I do n't think I can get out . but you can laugh , you can laugh , you can laugh , ' Cause you think that you be good than me . if we be the instigator of our time , why do we harmonize , then revolutionize our crime ? down in this sandpit of misbegotten youth we can show them the song , the one truth . but you can laugh , you can laugh , you can laugh , ' Cause you think that you be well than , you think that you be good than everyone . I be just try to do the right thing . I be just try to do the right thing . the right thing . escape to my eye escape to my eye escape to my eye escape to my eye _____________ name Sandpit Artist curve album Doppelg√§nger write by Toni Halliday , Dean Garcia
