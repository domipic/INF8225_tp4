you be too good for me , I do n't feel worthy . I have tell you this before , you have always know the score . ' cause only you can give me , the reassurance that I need . I have tell myself , though it do n't seem to help , tell myself , though it do n't seem to help , ' Cause only you can show me . can you see me ? for the shadow that I be . do you believe me ? when I be as shallow as I be . I be wait patiently , for the Polaroid to take hold . then all my secret , they will unfold . I only want someone , to lift me from despair . when I turn a corner , I will like you to be wait there . ' cause only you can teach me , the resource that I need . I hold myself , though it do n't seem to help . hold myself , though it do n't seem to help , ' Cause only you can show me . can you see me ? for the shadow that I be . do you believe me ? when I be as shallow as I be . I be wait patiently , for the Polaroid to take hold . then all my secret , they will unfold . ______________ name Polaroid Artist curve album Gift write by Toni Halliday , Dean Garcia
