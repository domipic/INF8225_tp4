I do this to myself the summer air burning in my lung one more glance till I come undo let be stop this rise sun bright light can see they always shine right through me leave me an open book of halfways and could-have-beens take us to the end , end , end and that summer change us it be well I admit that to myself Stuck trap in memory the tragic tale of you and me can n't get back to the way we be nothing else matter it be us against the world now it be just me suck in that summer air what a summer , I have no care how quick it all crash down not willing to bend , bend , bend and these struggle change us it be good to admit that to yourself Stuck trap in memory the tragic tale of you and me can n't get back to the way we be nothing else matter it be us against the world that morning come too soon what be we suppose to do one choice tear in two I know what you be put through and I think we have it we do n't have enough we ca n't go back we will never go back now this be the end _______________________ name Partners in Crime Artist comeback kid album Wake The Dead
