bow down and hail to the king ! I do n't care what people think Bow down with the face in the mud I be large than life , I do n't give a fuck the throne be mine , the crown fit fine I could n't care less about your cry my rug be red , Golden my bed I have everything but regret nothing to hold on King of kingdom go I be all alone Bow down and hail to the king ! I do n't give a fuck about anything ! I live among god , I dine in hell I be on top of the world and I never fail but within my towering wall I sing a song about an empty soul nothing to hold on King of kingdom go I be all alone where I walk there be light where I speak there be quiet darkness inside silence cry be this what I long to be ! ? who have I become ? a king of kingdom go I be try to hold on nothing to hold on King of kingdom go I be all alone I be all alone I be all alone __________ name King Artist Caliban album ghost empire
