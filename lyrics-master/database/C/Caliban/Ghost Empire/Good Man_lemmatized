as I lie here - reflect my life I be all alone , after all I have say and do . do you remember - all the time you cry in vain ? do you remember - all the time I let you down ? do you remember - all the time I could not ease the pain ? do you remember - all the time I let you down ? I do n't see me be a good man , no one be here to say goodbye I wish I could go back to my break past I be a break man with nothing leave I know you ca n't forgive - I wish you could forget ! do you remember - all the moment that I miss ? do you remember - all the time I could be love and kiss ? do you remember - all treasure I throw away ? do you remember - when I flee and should have stay ? I do n't see me be a good man , no one be here to say goodbye I wish I could go back to my break past I be a break man with nothing leave I know you ca n't forgive - I wish you could forget ! so here I be at the end of the road , I walk alone and nobody give a fuck ! ! ! fuck ! ! ! I wish I could go back to my break past I be a break man with nothing leave I know you ca n't forgive - I wish you could forget ! as I lie here - reflect my life I be all alone , after all I have say and do . ______________ name Good Man Artist Caliban album ghost empire
