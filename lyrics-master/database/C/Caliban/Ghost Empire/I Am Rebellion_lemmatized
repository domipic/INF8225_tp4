I be the dark of the night , the light of the day and everything in between I be nothing - I be different - where do I belong ? why do I hate myself so much - why ca n't I be strong ? I be a misfit - wo n't fit this - and nobody care I be a stranger to myself - I find it hard to hear would you realize when I disappear ? I be invisible like Neptune 's tear ! ! ! no storm will take our breath and blow us away the earth will shake with every word that we say when world collide - we will always stay ! ! ! there be a stranger inside of me , so deep inside of me - he will no longer be I be no one - an empty shell , a seeker - search for myself there be a reason - I be the way I be I be who I be - I be rebellion ! I be too different to be a part of you , but not in different to change the world ! no storm will take our breath and blow us away the earth will shake with every word that we say when world collide - we will always stay ! ! ! ____________________ name I be rebellion Artist Caliban album ghost empire
