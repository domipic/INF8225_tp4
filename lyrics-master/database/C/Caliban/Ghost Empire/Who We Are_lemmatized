we be look back on many year , lucky day and little tear we make mistake and have some fight , Blackend day and lonely night ! but we grow closer , the old we get whatever we do - we have no regret we be far from be perfect , but this be who we be we will walk this way together , with our heart right to the star can you feel my heart ! ? we be look forward to many year , Different care and different fear whatever tomorrow bring , I will walk with you the mistake we make - we wo n't make twice I tould you then , I tell you now - I will never let you down we be far from be perfect , but this be who we be we will walk this way together , with our heart right to the star can you feel my heartbeat ? - can you see my heart bleed ? I wanna thank you - for be strong I wanna thank you - for guide me home I wanna thank you - for be bright I will always hold you - I wo n't ever leave you behind we be far from be perfect , but this be who we be we will walk this way together , with our heart right to the star ________________ name who we be Artist Caliban album ghost empire
