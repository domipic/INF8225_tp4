what be the meaning , which be the drive that keep on hurt you ? my word be a double-edged sword , my wound be your scar of tomorrow ! no more 2nd chance , no more fuck chance . every step I make be wrong , it be like a ( fuckin ) nightmare and there be no more 2nd chance ! ! no more 2nd chance , no more fuck chance . all I can see be a horizon of pain ( and hatred ) , I just reflect cold emotion and I deserve the pain , maybe I will wake up one day ! ? no more 2nd chance , no more fuck chance . _________________________ name no more 2nd chance Artist Caliban album the undying darkness
