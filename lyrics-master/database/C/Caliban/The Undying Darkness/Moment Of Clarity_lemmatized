moment of clarity I be willing to suffer , to bleed-to die for the thing i care about but it be like kiss the lip of my dead love- like touch her dead cold white skin Ref : I choose to look back- to see myself I never want to hurt you again I choose to look back- to see myself I never want to loose you again I have be here before , ground zero the past be a gape hole my only chance be to turn around and face it I choose to look back to see myself- for her love for her heart for her trust for her love i be reborn ... ; Ref : I choose to look back- to see myself I never want to hurt you again I choose to look back- to see myself I never want to loose you again _______________________ name Moment of Clarity Artist Caliban album the undying darkness
