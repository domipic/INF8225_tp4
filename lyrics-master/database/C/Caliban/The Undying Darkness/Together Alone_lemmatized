your life be life , mine be just a lie your life be life , mine be just a lie time pass by , everything flow in the same stream and we be drive down the river , I pause and let you go , my tear whip the river , there I stand stiff forever , sing this song of mourn my cradle be full of hope I do n't give up , I break the wall ( and fight ) my cradle be full of hope I do n't give up , I break the wall ( and fight ) you be go your own way , float in another dream , you feel no fear , no doubt , your power keep real there will be new path , no doubt and well feed fear , we will go our way alone , together alone , let be go your life be life , mine be just a lie your life be life , mine be just a lie ____________________ name together alone Artist Caliban album the undying darkness
