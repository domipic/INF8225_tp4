stand up you have get to manage , I wont sympathize anymore . and if you complain once more , you meet an army of me . you be all right , there be nothing wrong , self sufficiency please ! and get to work . and if you complain once more , you meet an army of me . you be all right , there be nothing wrong , self sufficiency please ! you be on your own now , we wo n't save you , we wo n't save you , you be on your own now , we wo n't save you , your rescue squad be too exhaust . and if you complain once more , you meet an army of me . you be all right , there be nothing wrong , self sufficiency please ! ________________ name Army of Me Artist Caliban album the undying darkness
