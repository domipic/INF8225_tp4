now I be stand here alone at the end of the road , scream into the emptiness . why do we start this way together . ( although ) it be clear to me I would end up all alone , ( completely ) break and misuse by love ! ? I rape myself and I do n't know why , this whole thing make no sense at all ! have you ever understand me , have you ever feel the same , have you ever look in my eye , Burt my starve heart . I rape myself and I do n't know why , this whole thing make no sense at all ! my heart be a present , but you do n't understand . you be n't ready to go until the end together ( beside me ) that be why I be stand here all alone . scream into the emptiness I rape myself and I do n't know why , this whole thing make no sense at all ! ___________________ name I Rape myself Artist Caliban album the undying darkness
