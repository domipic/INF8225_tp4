certainty of emptiness , trustful , new pain and thought of the path there be just one constant : nothing be forever ! time of calm and peace , time to look inside , Relic picture of past , Black and white deceive , uncover the glance for my grief , nothing be forever ! I give my heart , my blood , nothing be forever ( but eternity ) . time of calm and peace , time to look inside , Relic picture of past , Black an d white deceive , uncover the glance for my grief , nothing be forever ! and in the end only haze remain , nothing be forever . I give my heart , my blood , nothing be forever ( but eternity ) . certainty of fate , fatal emptiness , an empty hope for future , how shapeless fate show , I fight for something eternal , time of calm and peace , time to look inside , Relic picture of past , Black and white deceive uncover the glance for my grief . nothing be forever ! ! ________________________ name nothing be forever Artist Caliban album the undying darkness
