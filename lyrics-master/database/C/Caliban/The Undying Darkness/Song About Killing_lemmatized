I be here to kill I be here to die I feel this pain I have this hate you teach me to love you teach me fear but now you be get it all back and my reason be just trivial try to run away but believe me to die this be your fate this be a song about kill a love letter just for you , let be make it right let be make it clear no one want you here all I want be to kill I want you dead the price be too high my life be too short I be sick of hunt you you be my shadow you be my demon you have to burn for my joy I will watch you burn so you well run before I will watch you burn try to run away but believe me to die be your fate this be a song about kill a love letter just for you let be make it right let be make it clear no one want you here ________________________ name song about kill Artist Caliban album the undying darkness
