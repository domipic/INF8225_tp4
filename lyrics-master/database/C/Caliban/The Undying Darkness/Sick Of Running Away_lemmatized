I have no energy to be , where be my will and drive to be happy ? you be give me hope , but everything seem to be illusion and smoke for love for life for surrender ! just one word and I will be yours just one word and I will burn again just one word for a new time Cause in your eye I see my self , I be sick of run away but in your eye what do I mean ? a name , one among of thousend other ? nasty and sweet be my thought but my desire ca n't be satisfy for love ( for love ) for life ( for life ) for surrender ! ( for surrender ) the bad shall be over now , your mental beautyness be stunning , my feeling for myself be overgrow of dry plant and I be sick and I be sick and I be sick I be sick and I be sick of run away ! I be sick Sick of run away ! just one word just one word for a new time Cause in your eye I see my self , I be sick of run away just one word and I will be yours just one word and I will burn again __________________________ name Sick of run away Artist Caliban album the undying darkness
