in our world fire burn brightly , take care or you get hurt , flame kiss you goodnight , in our world you cry . ashes be what be leave behind , you be dead in my head , in our world you cry we have go too far now , we fall too deep , it be our burden to bleed ! we - kill you all ! kill you all ! we - kill you all ! kill you ! we have go too far , we fall to deep , do n't you see ? it be our burden to bleed . our life be just a lie , our way just pain what happen , what be leave behind ? we have go too far now , we fall too deep , it be our burden to bleed ! we - kill you all ! kill you all ! we - kill you all ! die ! what be leave behind ? what be leave behind ? what be leave behind ? what be leave ... . . behind ? ______________________________ name it be our Burden to bleed Artist Caliban album the undying darkness
