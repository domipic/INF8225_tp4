write down a story I will rather forget wo n't mend the heart that be shatter and shred Lord know we try , lord know we fail mistrustful feeling slowly prevail we fade and fade from kiss to kiss with everything that lovely be we have both grow cold from fight to fight until our love have die all my dream be far away you take my life and give me hell give me back my yesterday or should I finally bid farewell never give all the heart for love no effort be ever good enough high result in low low , we disavow ' til it clearly show a bad hand deal , too blind with trust Gave you my all , till all be lose there ai n't no rise without a thorn our love could grow and be reborn and when you walk away then walk away my dear but when you turn around I wont be stand here no tomorrow no tomorrow all my dream be far away you take my life and give me hell give me back my yesterday or should I finally bid farewell all my dream be far away you take my life and give me hell give me back my yesterday or should I finally bid farewell no love no tomorrow no tomorrow ( no tomorrow ) _________________ name no Tomorrow Artist Caliban album I be nemesis
