I want to get high , so high . I want to get high , so high . I want to get high , so high . I want to get high , so high . well that be the funk elastic , the blunt I twist it , the slammified , Buddhafied , Funk on your diskus . oh what you miss this ? you get to bear witness . catch a ho , and another ho , Merry Christmas . yes I smoke shit , Straight off the roach clip , I roach it . fold the blunt at once , to approach it . forward motion , make you sway like the ocean . the herb be more than just a powerful potion . what be the commotion ? Yo , I be not joke around , people learnin ' bout what they be smoke . my oven be on high when I roast the quayle . tell Bill Clinton to go and inhale . exhale . now you the phunk of the Thai ' when I feel the effect I want to get high , so high . I want to get high , so high . I want to get high , so high . I want to get high , so high . ______________________ name I wanna get High Artist Cypress Hill album Black Sunday
