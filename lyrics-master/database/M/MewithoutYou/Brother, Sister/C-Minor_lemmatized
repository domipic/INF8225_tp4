our house wrap in disrepair , a small mouse peek out from a hole beneath the stair nearby to where my dad sit in his favorite chair , think about the gov't and mutter a prayer I scatter some oats in hope she will stay and sit still to stop from scare her away- but she hurry on her little way and scurry around my mind ever since , every day open wide my door , my door , my Lord ( open wide my door ) to whatever make me love you more ( open wide my door ) while there be still light to run towards ( open wide my door ) like water on dry wood Equal part misguide and misunderstand but all the neighborhood watch a fire burn from where they stand and the smoke say " we be not half as bad as G-d be good " and there be a whisper in my ear , the voice of loneliness and fear , so I say : " devil , disappear ! I be still ( ehh ... technically ... ) a virgin after @card@ years- which never bother me before , what be maybe @card@ more ? " open wide my door , my door , my Lord ( open wide my door ) to whatever make me love you more ( open wide my door ) while there be still light to run towards ( open wide my door ) she come back for the oats but she bring along a " friend " ( this never end ) ( this never end ) the harder the rain , the low the flower in the garden bend ( this never end ) ( this never end ) I will rather never talk again than to continue to pretend this never end ( this never end ) ( this never end ) _____________ name C-Minor Artist MewithoutYou album brother , sister
