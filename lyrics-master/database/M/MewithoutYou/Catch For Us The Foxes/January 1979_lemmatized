January , @ord@ Saw a terrible crash and i could n't help but laugh , as my ear press against the past like a glass on a wall of a house in a photograph . my forehead no longer sweet with holy kiss worthy of your fiery lip . I be float in a peaceful sea ' rescue ' by a sink ship . if I could become the servant of all , no low place to fall . ( if could be your servant ) if I could become the servant of all , no low place to fall . ( if I could be your servant ) if I could become the servant of all , no low place to fall . ( if could be your servant ) if I could become the servant of all , no low place to fall . ( if I could be your servant ) you watch me like a ten car highway wreck with detached , vulgar curiosity . this look down at the top of the hat of us passer-by from your 7th floor balcony . from such a height you miss creature too small for sight carry on covert conversation . and the misguided insect crown me their grasshopper king with a dance of celebration . after year with a crown on my head , I have grow overfeed , unconcerned and comfortably numb . keep busy indulge in the pleasure of the wealthy . ( someone make me afraid of what I have become ! ) at the first sign of possible sorrow , I turn my heel and run . ( oh , I will never learn . ) my life be a cup of sugar I have borrow before time begin and forget to return . it be a matter of time--I always say I could see so now I be go blind . ( I could be your servant ) it be a matter of time--I always say I could see so now I be go blind . ( if I could be your servant ) it be a matter of time--I always say I could see so now I be go blind . ( I could be your servant ) it be a matter of miserable time-- but I hear somewhere there be a cure for useless eye ? ( if I could be your servant ) __________________ name January @card@ Artist MewithoutYou album catch for U the fox
