I think I slip the net , but I cut myself free , I be not lose yet , so do n't forget me . I will say it , replay it , and try tomorrow . I will say it , replay it , and live with sorrow . you will think I learn by now , there be never an easy way , I will get through somehow , I be on my knee to pray , you will think I learn by now , there be never an easy way , I will get through somehow , I be on my knee . I will admit I be wrong , but I be get on track , I have be here too long , I be under attack . I will place it , replace it , and try to change . I will place it , replace it , and rearrange . you will think I learn by now , there be never an easy way , I will get through somehow , I be on my knee to pray , you will think I learn by now , there be never an easy way , I will get through somehow , I be on my knee to pray . on my knee to pray . I think I slip the net , but I cut myself free , I be not lose yet , so do n't forget me . I will say it , replay it , and try tomorrow . I will say it , replay it , and live with sorrow . you will think I learn by now , there be never an easy way , I will get through somehow , I be on my knee to pray , you will think I learn by now , there be never an easy way , I will get through somehow , I be on my knee to pray , I be on my knee to pray , on my knee to pray , on my knee to pray . _______________________ name never an Easy Way Artist Morcheeba album who can you Trust ?
