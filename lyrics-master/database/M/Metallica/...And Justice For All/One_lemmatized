I ca n't remember anything can n't tell if this be true or dream deep down inside I feel the scream this terrible silence stop with me now that the war be through with me I be wake up , I can see that there be not much leave of me nothing be real but pain now hold my breath as I wish for death Oh please God , wake me back in the womb it be much too real in pump life that I must feel but ca n't look forward to reveal look to the time when I will live Fed through the tube that stick in me just like a wartime novelty tie to machine that make me be cut this life off from me hold my breath as I wish for death Oh please God , wake me now the world be go I be just one Oh God help me hold my breath as I wish for death Oh please God , help me darkness imprison me all that I see absolute horror I can live I can die trapped in myself body my holding cell landmine have take my sight take my speech take my hearing take my arm take my leg take my soul leave me with life in hell _________ name One Artist Metallica album ... and Justice for All
