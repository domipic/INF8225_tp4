life it seem will fade away drift further every day get lost within myself nothing matter , no one else I have lose the will to live simply nothing more to give there be nothing more for me need the end to set me free thing not what they use to be miss one inside of me deathly loss , this ca n't be real can stand this hell I feel emptiness be fill me to the point of agony grow darkness take dawn I be me but now he have go no one but me can save myself but it be too late now I ca n't think , think why I should even try yesterday seem as though it never exist Death greet me warm , now I will just say goodbye goodbye ___________________ name fade to Black Artist Metallica album ride the Lightning
