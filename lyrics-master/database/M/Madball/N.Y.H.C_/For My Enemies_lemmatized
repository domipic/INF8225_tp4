I have be wait a long time to give you a piece of my mind . you can run but you ca n't hide from who you be inside and you do n't want to confront me . no ! I know your kind . you have be runnin the same old lie and keelin over on your mine . you will see it be all in a matter of time , you be gonna hafta confront me . cause we be all in this game , we do n't believe loyalty come for free . you only get respect when it be give out . make no mistake you be the enemy . make no mistake , you be my enemy . still here after many hard year . when will you realize , you ca n't kill what wo n't die ? cause they have try but the strong survive . I be only tellin you one time . still livin a lie , you have be cryin the word of gettin tired . how can talk with that closed mind ? you pass judgement , you cross the line you will never confront me . cause we be all in this game , we do n't believe loyalty come for free . you only get respect when it be give out . make no mistake you be the enemy . make no mistake check it . think I will back down ? you do n't know me i never back off , cause you be my enemy . ____________________ name for my enemy Artist Madball album N.Y.H.C.
