I love the silence I be in I think I dream this before some life seem so incomplete some just keep come back for more where do the time go ? where do the time go ? where do the time go ? I ca n't remember how it end do n't even know who I be a fading memory a fading image redrawn can n't wait for ever more where do the time go ? where do the time go ? where do the time go ? remember every thing I never say I have see the face before I hope the future be dead the dead keep ask for more where do the time go ? where do the time go ? where do the time go ? where do the time go ? ________________ name kaif Artist Ministry album Dark Side of the Spoon write by Allen Jourgensen , Louis James Svitek Jr , Paul G .
