lose in the magic from the last time this town turn , my rise to desire Saturday come slow , do you love me ? do you love me ? be there nothing there ? in the limestone cave , in the south way land one time in the kingdom , belief be on the stand Saturday come slow , do you love me ? do you love me ? be there nothing there ? Saturday come slow , do you love me ? do you love me ? do you love me ? do you love me ? be there nothing there ? ________________________ name Saturday Come slow artist massive Attack album Heligoland
