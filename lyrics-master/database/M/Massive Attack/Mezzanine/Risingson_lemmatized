I be die to leave every time we grind you know we sever line where have all those flower go , long time passing why you keep me test , keep me task ? you keep on ask Toy-like people make me boy-like Toy-like people make me boy-like they be invisible , when the trip it flip they get physical , way below my lip and everything you got be , hoi polloi like now you be lose , and you be lethal and now be about a time you gotta leave all these good people , dream on nice than the bird up in the tree-top cheap than the chip inside my laptop all the variation you could do with me nice than the girl up in your mind you be free automatic crystal remote control they come to move your soul you kinda fade into the background like a good smoke will bring you back round like a man slide inside you my dear your cheap beer be fill with crocodile tear See ' em run now you be go , dream on Toy-like people make me boy-like Toy-like people make me boy-like I find a reason , I find a reason dream on , dream on , dream on _______________ name Risingson Artist massive Attack album mezzanine
