do n't wake me up , I be win war inside my head . and maybe I be weak , but not beneath the cover of this bed . asleep , I be undefeated in this world of mine . so let me stay inside this dream , and keep me from the light . I build this place behind my eye you will never see . and you can move my body , but please keep my mind asleep . beyond the galaxy where there be no space or time . I will transform , I be reborn to rule over the sky . I I feel it in my bone , escape the world I know . it be all in my control . I just wanna see this way , blood pump in my vein . I feel it . I feel it ! behind the darkness , there be a sea of neon light . and maybe you think I be sink , but you just ca n't get inside . do n't try to save me when my mind be finally free . cause I will rather run my own world than face your reality . it be not enough for me to paint with black and white . inside my head there be shade of red unknown to wake life . you think you travel far and never see the star . cause the only way be if I say you can follow me that far . I I feel it in my bone , escape the world I know . it be all in my control . I just wanna see this way , blood pump in my vein . I feel it . I feel it ! ___________ name Seeya Artist Deadmau5 album Seeya
