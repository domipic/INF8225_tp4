you be weak and you be gullible , and I do n't care . you be a walk disaster , and I do n't care . you cry yourself to sleep , and I do n't care . you be waste our time , and I do n't care . you know this day would come , and it do , and you really should have wait . go cry yourself to sleep , and you should , because I be so fade . you know this day would come , and it do , and you really should have wait . go cry yourself to sleep , and you should , because I be so fade . you contradict everything , and I do n't care . your logic be twist , and I do n't care . I will pretend to be happy , and I do n't care . you cry yourself to sleep , and I do n't care . you be weak and you be gullible , and I do n't care . you be a walk disaster , and I do n't care . you know this day would come , and it do , and you really should have wait . go cry yourself to sleep , and you should , because I be so fade . you know this day would come , and it do , and you really should have wait . go cry yourself to sleep , and you should , because I be so fade . ______________ name careless Artist Deadmau5 album get scrape
