so we have be talk about ' cool ' and its uh ramification , and how it apply to the hip scene . but maybe you could give us some example now , of the opposite of cool - ' uncool ' , just exactly what be ' uncool ' ? yeah , why-n't-we have some thought on that ... It-it-it be uncool to nod on the street corner wait for the light to change . and uh it uh ... It-it be uncool to let anybody know your uncle be a registered pharmacist , uncool for the whole family . you know , it be uncool to buddy with a know fink . and it be uncool to ask " where will you get it ? " it be disastrously uncool to let friend use your penthouse as a forwarding address for package from Mexico . you know and it be uncool to ask " where will you get it ? " and it be uncool to wear shade after sunset . ______________________ name sometimes I Fail Artist Deadmau5 album get scrape
