here I lay ( still and breathless ) just like always ( still I want some more ) mirror sideways ( who care what be behind ) just like always ( still your passenger ) ( the chrome button , buckle on Leather surface these and other lucky witness ) now to calm me ( this time wo n't you please ) Drive faster ( Roll the window down this cool night air be curious let the whole world look in who care who see anything ? I be your passenger I be your passenger ) drop these down then put them on me Nice cool seat there to cushion your knee now to calm me ( take me around again ) do n't pull over ( this time wo n't you please ) Drive faster ( Roll the window down this cool night air be curious let the whole world look in who care who see what tonight ? roll these misty window down to catch my breath again go and go and do n't just Drive me home then back again ) here I lie just like always ( do n't let me go go , go , go , go go , go , go , go take me to the end ) _______________ name Passenger Artist Deftones album White pony
