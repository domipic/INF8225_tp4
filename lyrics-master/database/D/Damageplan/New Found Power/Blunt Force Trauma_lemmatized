yea ! I never see whatever it be that come and hit me from behind . then I awake enraged and confused , how could I have be so blind ? Life be escape , do n't pretend , judgement come , but who know when . so when you least expect that be when it take effect , a tragic twist to alter fate . instinct be to deny , Logic do not apply . in time we learn , but it be too late . blunt force trauma to the head ! blunt force trauma to the head ! blaze through life at the speed of sound . do n't stop to look at the sign . suddenly everything crash around you . when we forget , life remind . clock be run , fall sand , Time be slip through your hand . so when you least expect that be when it take effect , a tragic twist to alter fate . instinct be to deny , Logic do not apply . in time we learn , but it be too late . blunt force trauma to the head ! it be too late ! it be too late ! it be too late ! too late ! blunt force trauma . blunt force trauma . so when you least expect that be when it take effect , a tragic twist to alter fate . instinct be to deny , Logic do not apply . in time we learn , but it be too late . blunt force trauma to the head ! it be too late ! it be too late ! ________________________ name Blunt Force trauma Artist Damageplan album New find power write by Darrell Lance Abbott , Patrick A .
