why have we wait so long , suppress the power inside ? tear away all that be wrong , something too massive to hide . it be time to rip the chain from your neck , let go the past as you purge . free now from everything weigh you down , open the floodgate and surge with New find power ! New find power ! New find power ! New find power ! cleanse yourself of the past , Learn from mistake and move on . conquer new ground at last , unite and become twice as strong . it be time to rip the chain from your neck , let go the past as you purge . free now from everything weigh you down , open the floodgate and surge with New find power ! New find power ! New find power ! New find power ! nothing venture , nothing gain . hope be all that keep me sane . rise above and prove myself . I will survive without your help . shut you out , my strength come from within . New find power ! New find power ! New find power ! New find power ! New find power ! New find power ! New find power ! New find power ! power ! power ! _____________________ name New find Power Artist Damageplan album New find power write by Darrell Lance Abbott , Patrick A .
