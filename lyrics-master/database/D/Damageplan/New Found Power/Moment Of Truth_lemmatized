there be time when I question my reason . think I would n't last . seem the hand of God hold my head underwater . somehow I fight back . it be still not over yet . no , it wo n't let me quit . find myself more than just once pray down on my knee . my search for answer only lead to more question . sometimes for faith you have get to bleed . by now I have bleed my share , now it be my turn to redeem . when it come my way I wo n't be scare , I have be wait all my life . pain have prepare me for the moment of truth , and the true test this time . give all you have because you believe , sell your mortal soul . and if you be not a predator , then , oh - you better pray . bet it all now or fold . but there be still a danger there . do n't become one of them . when it come my way I wo n't be scare , I have be wait all my life . pain have prepare me for the moment of truth , and the true test this time . for all I have do - some good some bad , do n't hang me just yet ! judge me not on one thing I have do , see my whole life instead ! when it come my way , I wo n't be scare , I have be wait all my life . pain have prepare me for the moment of truth , and the true test this time . _____________________ name Moment of truth Artist Damageplan album New find power write by Darrell Lance Abbott , Patrick A .
