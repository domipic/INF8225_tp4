can you feel it building ? can you feel it building ? can you feel it building ? can you feel it building ? can you feel it building ? devastation be on the way . feel the hair on the back of your neck as the rush begin . you ca n't take it away , I earn this with sweat and blood . you ca n't take it away , take what be mine . breathe new life back into me , challenge all the power that be . can you feel , can you feel , can you feel , can you feel , can you feel , can you feel , can you feel , can you feel , can you feel ? can you feel it slip as you lose your grip on me ? can you face that I win in the end ? I ca n't keep from laugh . you ca n't take it away , I earn this with sweat and blood . you ca n't take it away , take what be mine . breathe new life back into me , challenge all the power that be . breathe new life back into me , challenge all the power that be . breathe new life . breathe new life . breathe new life . do n't you see it come ? when you have catch on , it be too late . when it hit , do n't forget who I be , do n't forget this face . you ca n't take it away , I earn this with sweat and blood . you ca n't take it away , take what be mine . breathe new life back into me , challenge all the power that be . breathe new life back into me , challenge all the power that be . breathe new life . breathe new life . breathe new life . breathe new life . breathe new life . ________________________ name breathe New Life Artist Damageplan album New find power write by Darrell Lance Abbott , Patrick A .
