go ! seem like only yesterday the dream become so clear . all be possible and God , it feel so near ! so I suffer and I bleed , I truly do believe . year have come and go , but just where have it bring me ? in the blink of an eye seem like minute as the year fly by . in the blink of an eye afraid to stop because I ca n't stop time . Strobing snapshot of my past become a blur flash just one thing can make it all come flood back if I have stop just once to look back maybe I would see just how far I have come , but it take it be toll on me in the blink of an eye seem like minute as the year fly by . in the blink of an eye afraid to stop because I ca n't stop time . blink of an eye ! blink of an eye ! blink of an eye ! that be just how fast your life can change . in the blink of an eye , everything be erase . in the blink of an eye seem like minute as the year fly by . in the blink of an eye afraid to stop because I ca n't stop time . in the blink of an eye seem like minute as the year fly by . in the blink of an eye afraid to stop because I ca n't stop time . _____________________ name blink of an Eye Artist Damageplan album New find power write by Darrell Lance Abbott , Patrick A .
