I be bear on a highway in a trainwreck with a heart that be beatin ' outta my chest so now I follow it around the world , I ca n't keep up if I do n't get it soon I know I will bleed until I drop ' Cause I want it all I ca n't get enough ' Cause I want it all I ca n't get enough there be a darkness and a hollow on the highway every cross on the road side tell a story so now I follow it around the world , I ca n't keep up the story never end as long as we have blood and gut ' Cause I want it all I ca n't get enough ' Cause I want it all I ca n't get enough can n't get enough I ca n't get enough it run off the track , @card@ / @card@ while the immigrant sleep , there be n't much time the mayor come Callin ' and got ' em outta bed they pack up their family and head up wind a poison cloud , a flaming sky @card@ , @card@ people and no one die and all before the pocket dial yeah I keep searchin ' and searchin ' I keep searchin ' and searchin ' now I be strand , tie on the track there be no hero , there be no villain there be nobody I can blame , the story be still the same I be never satisfy , it be a problem with my brain I keep searchin ' and searchin ' I keep searchin ' and searchin ' ' Cause I want it all I ca n't get enough ' Cause I want it all I ca n't get enough ( can n't get enough ) I ca n't get enough ( can n't get enough ) I ca n't get enough ( can n't get enough ) I ca n't get enough ( can n't get enough ) I ca n't get enough _____________________ name Trainwreck @card@ artist death from above @card@ album the Physical World
