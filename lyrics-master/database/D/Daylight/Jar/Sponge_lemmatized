I leave my head at home , bury in the backyard with the dog . I have think of leave more time than once . I be leave you all alone . I try so hard to be the rock , but all I feel like be a wet sponge . I want to run , I just ca n't . the thing it take to be a man I be on a road I be not proud of the thing I have do do n't let my living bring you down you will never know how much it hurt to nod when I be the son I will never stand and watch you drown I be under a spell . this be n't what I want for us . we have hold it all together this long . my spine deep as well . my heart be big than you know . this family be just a sad song I want to run , I just ca n't . the thing it take to be a man . I be on a road . I be not proud of the thing I have do . do n't let my living bring you down . you will never know how much it hurt to nod when I be the son I will never stand and watch you drown ____________ name sponge artist daylight album jar
