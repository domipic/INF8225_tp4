I have be run all night long and the pulse be pound in my chest now I be here , there be feeling that I just must express open for me , I be stand outside your door whatever you say , do n't say it be too late open for me , can wait out here anymore whatever you say , do n't say it be too late Gotta get this outta my system I have gather my strength , rip my blindfold off I be ready now , I have stay in the dark with my mind switch off open for me , I be stand outside your door whatever you say , do n't say it be too late open for me , can wait out here anymore whatever you say , do n't say it be too late I do n't wanna be out here on my own I do n't wanna be outside in the cold I do n't wanna be completely alone I just wanna be right where I belong Ergh ! open for me whatever you say , do n't say it be too late open for me , I be stand outside your door whatever you say , do n't say it be too late ( open for me ) can wait out here anymore ( whatever you say ) do n't say it be too late ______________ name Too Late Artist Dead by April album incomparable
