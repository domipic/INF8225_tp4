go be the flame go be the tear and pain that burn me that hurt me some day I could barely get through still I know I stand never too far from you look at me now , I make it feel my heart now , I make it reach thing now , I never think possible here I be now , I make it here be my life , my true dream I be not afraid even through the dark moment I never give up in my mind what I be reach for be come close My dream never fade out I never give it up look at me now , I make it feel my heart now , I make it reach thing now , I never think possible here I be now , I make it here be my life , my true dream I see you in me I feel you near me I feel you near me I see you in me I never give up I never give it up look at me now , I make it look at me now , I make it feel my heart now , I make it look at me now I make it ( look at me now ) feel my hope now , I make it ( look at me now ) reach thing now , I never think possible here I be now , I make it here be my life , my true dream _______________ name I Made it Artist Dead by April album Dead by April
