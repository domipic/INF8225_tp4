put my trust in you my love defend you Dispite our past I still breathe for you the sign be choose for destiny and this be all I see . leaf fall down fall side by side All I predict have now begin leaf fall down anywhere I hide all I be have now in tear I drown . you make my belief grow a little strong I be a dead end ca n't feel it no long when I dream I be still awake and this be what I see . leaf fall down fall side by side All I predict have now begin leaf fall down anywhere I hide all I once have now in tear I drown . leaf fall down one by one leaf fall down in tear I drown leaf fall down one by one leaf fall down in tear I drown leaf fall down fall side by side All I predict have now begin its fall to piece all I once have now in tear I drown leaf fall down fall side by side All I predict have now begin leaf fall down anywhere I hide all I once have now in tear I drown . ____________________ name leave Falling Artist Dead by April album strong
