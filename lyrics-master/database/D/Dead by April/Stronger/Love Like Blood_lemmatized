we must play our life like soldier in the field but life be short i be run fast all the time Strength and beauty destine to decay so cut the rise in full bloom ' til the fearless come and the act be do a love like blood , a love like blood ' til the fearless come and the act be do a love like blood , a love like blood we must dream of promised land and field that never change in season as we move towards no end we learn to die Red tear be shed on grey ' til the fearless come and the act be do a love like blood , a love like blood ' til the fearless come and the act be do a love like blood , a love like blood ' til the fearless come and the act be do a love like blood , a love like blood ' til the fearless come and the act be do a love like blood , a love like blood _____________________ name love like Blood Artist Dead by April album strong
