crazy weather too near the eye of the storm the ice that crack our wall our tiny shelter from the cold we raise the curtain for endless rain a tricky thought stick in back of your brain Slippery the cradle , water that burn silent the hour , wait our turn our body our changing beneath the touch of the rain we will build a new constellation we will save ourselves for good day play for me play that on my grave now you will play for me play from the eye of the storm we run for shelter when everything change we make a promise to keep thing the same play for me play for some kind of control it keep us whole how hollow heart crack the wall around me out of the eye of the storm Endless the rain Endless the rain these be the rule Learn to play and what you take from here no price can pay you will play for me now play for some kind of control it make us whole study the line Learn your part you will play for me play for some kind of control leave outside the frost leave its mark save , safe in the dark play for me play that on my grave now you will play for me play from the eye of the storm we run for shelter when everything change we make a promise to keep thing the same play for me play for some kind of control it keep us whole _________________ name good Days Artist Dead when I find her album Rag Doll Blues Year @card@ original text by Michael Arthur Holloway
