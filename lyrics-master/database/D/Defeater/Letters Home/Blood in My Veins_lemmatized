can you hear those bird sing ? mean we be close to shore mean we be close to home further from love and war further from what make sense what we be bear to do what keep the blood in our vein keep my vein thin with booze keep my hand on my gun and my gun by my side keep the moon in my thought with the sun in my eye keep my head hanging low keep my gun by my side My brother 's name in my head and the tear from my eye keep the blood in my vein keep the blood in my vein brother 's name in my head keep the blood in my vein have me pray for death for me and my friend so we would never wake up to our lover again because every lover have lie when they say we will be fine when they say in good faith they would sleep alone every night Hope to come home in one piece with our boy by our side now we be ragged and the tear like the flag that we fly like the one we lie down on a coffin so clean see those eye stare back the boy we use to be keep the blood in my vein ( I re-read the postcard you send , wish the truth be a lie ) keep the blood in my vein ( the wave on the hull , throw your word off the side ) brother 's name in my head ( the ship take the deed and die back home ) and the blood in my vein ( I want to sing to the depth , with the letter you write ) keep the blood in my vein keep the blood in my vein brother 's name in my head and the blood in my vein keep the blood in my vein _______________________ name Blood in my vein artist defeater album Letters Home
