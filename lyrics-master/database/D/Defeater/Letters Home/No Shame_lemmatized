another day when the sun ai n't shine another night with the bottle I drown in still hope , still wait still breathe by a thread , still hold on to my demon to every die wish I have have of us leave this old ghost town still drag us down to pull you out of this hell you have be live in with the needle and every die wish I have have that you would clean up your up and let down pull me underground with every tired lie you tell just to fill your arm you thin your vein with the dirt with the hurt with the memory and the pain still hope , still wait still breathe by a thread , still hold on and I lose my faith in your god in your word in every promise that you break still hope , still wait still breathe by a thread , still hold on so I walk the same way home each night to find that back-alley pusher and take his life and I ai n't ashamed for what I have do I will take an eye for an eye until every junkie be blind the river bed hold the blood and the knife and I ai n't ashamed for what I have do I take his eye as a prize the man who lay with my wife lay at the bottom of that river where the sun never shine another day when the sun ai n't shine another night with the bottle I drown in still hope , still wait still breathe by a thread , still hold on still hold on another day when the sun ai n't shine another night with the bottle I drown in still hope , still wait still breathe by a thread , still hold on still hold on still hope , still wait still breathe by a thread , still hold on ______________ name no shame artist defeater album Letters Home
