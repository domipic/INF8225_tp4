( you have get to find her . ) your mother ai n't fit to be alone . her rosary bead be go , there be only one place she will be . the sun be nearly up , put your jacket back on and walk down the street . feel the wind start to shift , cold and biting . just like everything that be change . when you do find her , ( when you do find her ) take the only family that you have get back to home . head down , walk through the crowd and the family downtown . you jealous bitter old man , it be just yourself you ca n't stand . the man that take away your wife , coward that leave you behind , you would kill them both if you could . ( kill them both if you could ) Head down , cigarette in hand . concrete , cold brick and sando the place where she pray , where she suffer her day . sleepless night with the dirt when the addiction hurt . up to that old white oak door church . and that be where you find her in that last pew . you touch her cold hand , your mother be go . in front of her God , needle in her arm . the family plot will be fill . the perfect ending to a tragedy . put her in the cold wet ground . finally at peace with her husband now . lose all will , empty house . hour strain , but month pass alone with your gun . blue-collar shipyard , your day have go . lose it all for the promise of a normal life . all take from you when you lose your wife . so you sit in that chair , wait for death , barrel to your head . ______________ name at Peace Artist defeater album empty day & sleepless night
