unwanted , but breathing . in the next room , sleeping . my mother , she be cry and my father have be drink . in our run down apartment , where the roof be still leak . he be curse and cussing , it be just the whiskey talk . I have get lot of memory like this one . of empty day and night spend tired and lonesome . when I think back to all of it , well it be all too much , well it be all too much when you be just a little kid . my little brother , just a newborn baby . in the image of my mother , she say he be a blessing . but not to my father , oh how he hate him . " an undeserving mistake . " he call him a burden . I have get lot of memory like this one . of pick side and pick fight between them . when I think back to all of it , well it be all too much , well it be all too much when you be just a little kid . when I wake up in the morning it all feel like a bad dream , one that follow you and haunt you endlessly . yeah haunt me endlessly . break and beat from the abuse and the cheating , the addiction , the lie and the promise of leave . while my old man be a bastard , I admire and love him . us two kid , we be bear in to a family , not a fortune . ___________________ name but breathing artist defeater album empty day & sleepless night
