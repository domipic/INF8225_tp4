" Dear God , what have you do ? " those word ring loud in the back of your head . that bottle lie in a thick , blood red . " I ai n't no forgiver , forgetter . " our mother wait in vain for a God that never love us . as much as she pray , he never show up . " Dear God , where have you go ? " your brother be go in the blink of an eye . that January night , our father lay cold . " where be you go to go ? you be only seventeen year old . " " I ai n't no forgiver , forgetter . " our mother wait in vain for a God that never love us . as much as she pray , he never show up . those cold steel track beneath your foot , those same rail tie where you dodge those train . when we be just two kid , it still feel the same ; that warm blood rush when the train come . ( when the train come ) " I ai n't no forgiver , forgetter . " " I will find you , and put that vice to your head . again , and again , and again , and again , and again .
