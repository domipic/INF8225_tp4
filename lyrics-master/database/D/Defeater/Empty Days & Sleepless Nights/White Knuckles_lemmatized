you be go to find him , and make him pay . stumble out to the bar . " take one more look at her , and it will be the end of your day . you low-life bookie , you do n't scare me . I ai n't settle no debt , I ai n't save no face . one more drink then I be go and then I will drag you out of this place . " put it down for the courage , your fist clench with the blood rush . White knuckle when the hit land , Cold concrete and blur vision . stumble home from the bar . stutter step home to your front door . on the tip of your tongue , your remorse . shame by the loss and defeat . shame by your let down to her . the same walk as that first night . now alone you know that this ai n't right . good day and the promise you make , Ai n't no man suppose to walk out that way . her ring lie in the thick red , your tear swell , and the room spin . " Dear God , what have I do ? " you leave her , and he take her , he lay with her . you bastard 's son . with the blackout and the bloodstain , your tooth clench , then the pain come . ____________________ name White Knuckles Artist defeater album empty day & sleepless night
