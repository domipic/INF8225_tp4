Let 's talk about the old day let be talk about your friend let be talk about the summer and how you wish it would n't end do I forget to tell you how pretty you look in that dress ? in the first time that I see you you clean the mess from my head and I do n't mind if we take our time no , I do n't mind let go walkin ' on the boardwalk dip our foot into the sea let find ourselves lose for hour until we find ourselves a drink let talk that sun into set just need the sound of your voice need that calming and the comfort something to drown out the noise and I do n't mind if we take our time ' Cause I be all yours if you be all mine something I have be meanin ' to tell you about three year and a day I will very much like to get marry maybe have kid and move away ' Cause there ai n't nothing like your smile your leg and those eye I will beg and steal and borrow to keep you safe your whole life and I do n't mind if we take our time ' Cause I be all yours if you be all mine __________________ name I do n't mind Artist defeater album empty day & sleepless night
