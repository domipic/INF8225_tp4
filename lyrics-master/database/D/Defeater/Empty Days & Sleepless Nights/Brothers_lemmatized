you need to get out of this house . I will walk you down to town . we will go act our age , kick rock , waste summer day . penny candy at the general store , I will buy us a pop if I have more . keep walk inland all day , spit and curse each other name . " ai n't this what , ai n't this what brother be suppose to do ? " the blood between us , make it all but true . so we roll on through out past the quarry and sandpits too . swim out among the rock and cliff , ignorant youth keep us from death . find our way out to the track . the sun , it beat down on our back . heaven help us if there be a train , Dodge it like the beach of Normandy . " ai n't this what , ai n't this what brother be suppose to do ? " the blood between us , make it all but true . we see that smoke rise over tree and I swear , I swear , I swear , that train be out for me . so I hold him tight and feel those track rumble underneath . he swear , he swear if I do n't let go he would knock me off my foot , and that be what he do . ______________ name Brothers Artist defeater album empty day & sleepless night
