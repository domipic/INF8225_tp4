as the wave crash , the cloud roll . sit on the dock wait for the sun . wait for the coward but he never come . pray for revenge on him . steam rise as the boat come in , one by one ( one by one ) . you know she be go , you know there be no save her . you know she be go , you know . her cheating , her weak will , the addiction , that needle . when you come home to find her lie on the floor , you be remind of those sleepless night that will haunt you for the rest of your life . blue collar shipyard , any way to keep her alive . Sun up to sun down , blister hand and a parched mouth . you know she be go , you know there be no save her . you know she be go , you know . her cheating , her weak will , the addiction , that needle . ______________________________ name wave crash , cloud Roll Artist defeater album empty day & sleepless night
