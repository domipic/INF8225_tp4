the way she look at you , tear stream down her face . you feel the brush of her dress as she walk away . and that be all it take , sit down to buy her a drink . an empty or a half full glass , it all go down the same . and that be the way that it have be , year later she take your name . hopeful and now unafraid . your gut sink each time you see her . another night at the Copper Coin . another night , another night . and that be all it take , sit down to buy her a drink . an empty or a half full glass , it all go down the same . and that be the way that it have be , year later she take your name . hopeful and now unafraid . your gut sink each time you see her . tell me about the old day . another night at the Copper Coin . tell me about the old day . put the sun into the sea . because there ai n't nothing like your smile , your leg and those eye . tell me about the old day . because there ai n't nothing like your smile , your leg and those eye . and I will beg and steal and borrow to keep you safe for your whole life . _________________ name empty Glass Artist defeater album empty day & sleepless night
