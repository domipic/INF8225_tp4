it still look the same here after all these year . the junkie and the steamboat man , the sun never set on them here . he walk to his rundown home , hell-bent to find his mother , but all that fear come back when he be greet by his brother . " it be not the same here . " " oh , i never think you would come right to me . I have spend year on these dock just wait after you leave , we be leave with nothing . every day what you do run through me . you selfish fuck . it be your fault , ca n't you see ? your addict mother be dead . now , be you happy ? you be leave with nothing . now . you will pay your debt to me . you coward , cheat thief . down at those long steel track , your life be my payback . " " I bet you wish you be dead . " they walk the rail with a gun to his head . and so he lie on the tie , just wait . those race thought through his head come rush . he slip out from the weight of the elder . the young 's fear once again topple over . and now it be his upper hand , he see the steam overhead . this will be the last the elder breathe again . roll on through , that train bear down . as it end his day , he somehow know it would always be this way . so end that cold heart 's legacy . ___________ name debt artist defeater album travel
