" there be no place for me . " a man of nowhere , a man of black heart from the dead end street . " regret run through me . I be no one , I be nothing , I be a man of defeat . what be leave for me ? " think of those open road , his mother pray all alone , that vagrant anthem and the field sing hymn , the cowardice forever follow him . " what be leave for me ? the world have turn it be back on me . there be no place for me . " a sullen walk to the chapel stair . " regret run through me . " a hard pull on that white oak door to face up those fear . " what bring you here my son ? " " I have be a horrible man . I kill my father , I kill my brother , I leave my mother in your God 's hand . " " clasp your hand and count your sin . kneel at the pew until the sermon begin . no judgment cast down this day , will set you free . you be forgive my son , you be bless and redeem . you have find absolution here son , but only from me . " " what be leave for me ? " a sullen walk to the steeple top to look over the city . he carve his name in that old brass bell , so when it ring he can hear it in hell . one last look to that western sky , one last wish he could have change his life . " I ai n't no wicked man . " he let his fleet slip from under him , unwanted . _______________ name cowardice artist defeater album travel
