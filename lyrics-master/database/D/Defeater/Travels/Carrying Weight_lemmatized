that soap box song stick in his head . burden lie in grave past by . he carry his weight . that anthem for the disenchanted ring loud in wave of grain . heavy heart hymn hear in slum fade out on those country road . hope burning in his lung . day pass , week pass . sleep under sky . day pass , week pass . day turn into night . sleep sound , the sun be out . sleep long , sleep well . day pass , week pass . memory come flood back , he pray his mother 's God have save her soul . that soap box song still in his head . mile lose to heat and rain . he carry his weight . that message for the misdirect ring true to this day . heavy heart hymn sing in field . he stop along that country road to listen as they sing . " swing low , swing low chariot for me . swing low , swing low . pray my soul to keep . " rest now , the sun be down . rest long , rest well . swing low , swing low . " redemption lie in an old farm house . " room and board for the strong hand we need . all i can offer be roof over head . another day , another dollar .
