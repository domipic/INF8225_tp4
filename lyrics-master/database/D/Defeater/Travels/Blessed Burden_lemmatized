March . @card@ unwanted from his first breath . a mother 's blessing bear , a father 's burden worn . the bright shine of the sunrise along the tile floor to the open door . with blood on the street she lie on the mattress . stare aimlessly . numb , dark and decay on the bathroom floor of their rundown apartment . scrape finger on tile just to feel something . unwanted by a bastard father . unwanted , but through the hazel eye of his mother . she be pray for god to save her . " please save me . " but when she need him most , he do n't answer . another rosary , another unanswered plea . " please take us away , please let us be safe . let everyone that see me forget my face . " but all she get be the drunk with his fist and that old devil look in his eye . him and Jack , that gambling debt , that old devil look in his eye . and without warn he raise his hand to her and say , " your god ca n't hear you , not down here . no one will save you because no one care . " and with her newborn boy , they would cry until the early morning light . it be the first of many , many sleepless night . ____________________ name bless Burden Artist defeater album travel
