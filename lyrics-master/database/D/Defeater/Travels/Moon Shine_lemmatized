" if you be always run , you ai n't no kind of man . face up your fear kid , fight for what you take stock in . out here on roll hill , there ai n't no alibi . only sweat and dirt , only that open sky . if you take nothing more than these simple word , with your head hold high kid , you will have your day . you can leave hardened , i wo n't think twice of it . if you get a battle back home , you get no reason to stay . " out there on roll hill , he think of day back home . all the pain and hurt , his mother pray alone . sleep never come for him , no rest for wicked man . in those starless sky , the moon shine shame on him . he find redemption in pale saint that take him in . his grey eye , hopefulness , that only youth can feel before life sour them . " where you from , where you be ? " the boy would ask . he could never answer , it be the truth he lack . " i be from nowhere kid , i have be to hell and back . i be a lone kid , i get no grace and no tact . " he have nothing more than those simple word . he be a runner and a coward always lose his way . still no sleep for him . " i ai n't no wicked man . " there would be no night like this for him ever again . he would change his fate , he would mend the break . he leave that night with part word to lead his way . " do n't you be like me . " and so that moonlit sky shine praise down on him . ________________ name Moon Shine Artist defeater album travel
