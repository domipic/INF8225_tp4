roll on through to the other side of town . pass the quarry , the river bed , over bridge and bunker shed . roll on through to the pit and the rail car yard . " this be where you prove your worth . " a brother 's dare , that devil 's smirk . " oh , this be the way it will always be . " a kid brother in the shadow of a cold heart 's legacy . " oh , this be where we see who run first . it be you and me and the train . the steel track and the dirt . oh , you can never live up to me . " and so he stand tremble , wait for smoke above the tree . roll on through . he could feel it rumble , he could feel it beneath his foot . roll on through . " closer now , hold your ground . steadfast , ignore the sound . " everything go quiet just before the rush take over his head . the pull and the push of the engine , think back with the coal and the steam . the racing thought , the question , the adolescent rivalry . and with a nod from the elder , the young 's fear topple over . over rail and over timber . " that be no dodge , you fuck coward . " and the train roll on . " yellow-belly go home . " and the train roll on . ___________________________ name everything Went Quiet Artist defeater album travel
