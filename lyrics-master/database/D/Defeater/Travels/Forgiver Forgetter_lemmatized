he awake in a cold sweat to those old sound of heartbreak . his brother at his side scream " this be n't your fight . " but that rush take over his head and he come to his mother 's side . and he find himself alone with that devil ramble . " oh , well the money be all go and she ca n't pay the rent with that needle in her arm . " he clench his fist . " what do she ever do to you , but raise us by herself when you be too drunk to come through ? " he take a swing . " that be some nerve you get kid . " " yeah , well they will put that on your tombstone as the last thing that you say . I never want to kill a man , like i want to kill you , man . " the year of pain boil over , trading blow across the counter . and when that devil be down he grab for his empty old friend Jack . he catch his eye as he take his last breath and that vice go to his head again and again . " Dear God , what have you do ? " cry out his mother . " that devil drunk be no father . another name on a list for unpaid bookie and gambling debt . " that spiteful stare of his brother . " I ai n't no forgiver or forgetter . I will make you pay for this when you least expect it . " he wash the blood from his hand , kiss his mother and step into cold night air . ________________________ name forgiver forgetter artist defeater album travel
