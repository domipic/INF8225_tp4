hard rain fall . chalk it up to a failure . push through the cold weather . race heart , slow the beat , push through the defeat . no one know , just push through the deadbeat , junkie , liar and cutthroat . the same walk , the same pier . no one be go to remember him here . " just walk until you reach those long steel track . " that old familiar sting , the memory of rivalry . year pass and it be still here . the same dirt , the same rail , the same fear . and all the year of give in rush through his head again . with no loss to match his gain , he roll on to hop that train . that rain fall hard . chalk the mile from his failure . tree sway with the weather . race heart , slow the beat . every cross town line be relief . with no money and no name , state line , border river be all the same . the city by dawn , a stranger with no history come . " just rest your head where the sun set . fade out at sun down . " ______________________ name the City by Dawn Artist defeater album travel
