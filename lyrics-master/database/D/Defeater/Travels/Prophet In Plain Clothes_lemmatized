he walk the street collar up to the snowfall . hole in pocket and knee . sleep in bar room and horse stall . but you ca n't stay too long in one place . " move along kid , we do n't like your face . " Mother 's hold child close out of fear . Father 's curse under breath as they sneer . he walk the street , year pass by with the snowfall . time be waste in drink , day beg and lose soul . hold no merit in vagrant in boxcar . down in hell you well know who your friend be . " not so proud scrounge for your next meal . no alibi sell when with devil you deal . how do it feel to be all alone with no direction ? home be never home , it be just the place where you come from . " " home be never home , " writ on wall of the church and the hostel . " home be never home , " say by martyr and lose soul . " home be never home , " say the prophet in plain clothes as he strum his guitar . and he scream , and he sing : " well I have be tire because I do n't sleep that well on train . well i get up and down but day be all the same . I have be low but it never get me down . well I have be throw out , I have be let down , I have be shame . well I have have hardship , I have be strip of pride and name . I have be low but it never get me down and i spend drinkin ' all the worry from my head in day spend wonderin ' , wishin ' I be dead . if only i could muster the word out from my mouth . I would sing . Oh i would sing . I will take the next train out . cause I have be hopin ' I have be prayin ' there be some God . so when i die I be save and find and I be not lose . cause all he be do , all for me be take away the one I love . and i spend drinkin ' all the worry from my head . in day spend wonderin ' , wishin ' Q be dead . . if only I could muster the word out from my mouth . I would sing . oh , i would sing . I will take the next train out . I be gonna take it ... " ______________________________ name Prophet in Plain clothes artist defeater album travel
