as a kid the summer seem so long . the dusk ; a never end song . too much , too young . he will never hear it again . a walk through the dismal street , the alley where the junkie sleep . too much , too young . " that will never be me . " slow , hand in hand to the boardwalk 's end . his mother 's word like the biting wind . " please do n't leave me . " he will never hear them again . " keep quiet , stay out of sight . " her sunken eye that use to burn so bright . " please do n't leave me . " so he hide press against the wall , under stair in the darken hall . the sound of heartbreak remind him of home . shadow move slow across the floor , a minute seem like a day or more . the end of heartache when she open the door . the sight , sound , smell of burn out shame , pride , spite and love . they all come here to die . he sob , " please take me a away . please mother bring us home safe on nameless street the way we come . " suddenly , she pray for good day and for redemption . sullenly she pray to keep from harm 's way and for conviction . but there be no forgiveness here . no hope beyond that pier . no way to get out now , not for her in this dead end town . and that drunk be wait up , him and jack and the empty cup . " where you be ? what you on ? who will you fuck ? " one more drink to toast good luck . she get a stiff hand from the old like the bourbon he have be drink . Black out . ______________________ name nameless Streets Artist defeater album travel
