dead alive . sleep walk through these last few week , and still you persist to suffocate the last breath of life from my lung . now my last thought be of you scream my name . the anguish in your voice as I collapse in pain . do n't hold your breath for me , because I will let you down . now as I be lose my voice , never find . and if you get there , do n't even bother call , cause by the time you read this . instill in me your dignity . with pride you be another life of possibility . run the clock down on us . I live in the corner you have back me into . and if you get there , do n't even bother call , cause by the time you read this , I will be go . and when I say I love you , I swear to god I lie . die motherfucker , you and your reason why . be I tear apart your life , because you be tear apart mine . now you wo n't see what I have make for you . inside I give you everything . rely on me until I shatter . instill with me the peace you find . and so I be never come back , until you be go . I ca n't save you , I ca n't save you . but I want to be hopeful . I do n't know you , I do n't know you , but I want to . _________________ name Pillow Talk Artist the kill tree album Bury Me at Make-Out Creek
