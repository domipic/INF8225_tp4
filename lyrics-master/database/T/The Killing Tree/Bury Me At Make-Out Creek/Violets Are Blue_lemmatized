somehow I know that this would end and then I finally find my way back home . and this be all one master plan to keep us spin down this endless well I be drown in my own regret I be try so hard to take what be my last breath . this be all I want from you . so alone and now I will have you know if you can stand on your own two foot then you can get up off your fuck knee . stand up and wash away the blood that stain your soul . you have give me reason to tear you apart . now you ca n't fix whats already break now I will have you know . do n't surrender , never give up your fuck life . you lie about your pride in self . I push from inside your skin I eat you away from within you will never see the sun again I will have you know look away from this break mirror now the time have come to slow the beating of this heart . ______________________ name Violet be Blue Artist the kill tree album Bury Me at Make-Out Creek
