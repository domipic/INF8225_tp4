I have see nation I have see empire rise and fall in your eye just enough to come crawl back to you but not enought to turn the tide the song she sing infect my ear the dance she dance fill my eye helpless to her beckon inside her smile I be hypnotize no one get out of here alive I be count to infinity with you so do n't worry about me either way I will despiese you at least put up a fight give me something to do I be count to infinity with you so let me hear you scream my name until the blood drip from your throat so come let play these game until we bleed or until we choke you spend your life just withe you be dead so you try and try but then say these thing take time so overwhelm with guilt that cloud my head I will trade these thought of you fro something else instead so come on in right now this water fine let me clip your wing so you can never leave I be give up on thought of infinity ( scream my name ) . __________________________ name count to infinity artist the kill tree album the Romance of Helen Trent
