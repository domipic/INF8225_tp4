I never notice the color of your eye until I see them in the reflection of this knife . green with envy for a life you never have . bloodshot contempt when I extend my hand ( so breathe and show us what you have get underneath clench your fist until they bleed ) see how and why I know I do n't think that this be what I want anymore I do n't care if God can save me now here I sit with hand cup and head bow and I wonder if you be out there have you see my name in light ? I do n't care at all in this world of kiss & tell I have get no story to speak of now silence fill this empty hole so naive to think , that I could make you feel one thing this excavation of my chest have produce nothing Bow your head and pull your eye down to see my hand around your wrist turn and twist this blade deeper into me ( you ca n't always get what you want but if you try sometimes you will die on you knee ) Wait ' til the perfect come until it come _________________ name the Perfect Artist the kill tree album the Romance of Helen Trent
