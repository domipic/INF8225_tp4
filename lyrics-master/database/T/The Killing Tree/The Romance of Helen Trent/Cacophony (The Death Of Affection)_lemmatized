lie with those sweet word that fall from your lip Stare so cold and calculate worth the risk escape from this life of expectation to finally die free the virus grow inside my head here it make me speak in scream and whisper no need to apologize I see deceit behind your eye there be nothing leave for us here Start a war a war for two a final suicide I can share with you the death of affection under your discretion breathe life to the lifeless breathe life ________________________________________ name cacophony ( the death of affection ) artist the kill tree album the Romance of Helen Trent
