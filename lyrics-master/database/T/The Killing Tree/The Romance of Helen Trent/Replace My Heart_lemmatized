reap my soul . I whisper cruel word that only I can hear . I dream in a never end line of tragedy . reap my soul disposition neckbraced by insecurity . let freedom ring in my ear painfully . and muffle this bell with the hand of pessimism and render it useless . you ca n't stop this thought like a pass trainwreck it barrel through my brain , paralyze . in this state your word become the dagger and I be left bleed . these wound of trust I know as tunnel vision create my only sanctuary . as hope manifest itself in the thought of an end . a die breath . reap my soul . I be not sure I can go on . so drag me down into your world . replace my heart with your machine and see if it still bleed . become my enemy . reap my soul my eyeslids become my enemy I fight them to save myself from the scene . as the groundwork for my nightmare be create I stand helpless to this chaos in my head and yet the chaos stand beautifully now like a carefully design city of conformity . and I will keep you awake tonight and I will hurt you until sunrise in this attempt to displace this push attack on my sense . reap my soul I be not sure I can go on . now drag me down into your world . replace my heart with your machine and see if it still bleed I will cover my track so you ca n't trace this accident to me . drag me down now . ______________________ name replace my Heart Artist the kill tree album the Romance of Helen Trent
