I be wear thin , wear out , become weak Holding hand with this rope she be my self-destructive bleeding disease the thing that make it hard to breathe but if I shove you far away this addict just starve again , asphyxiate and now I see it be you that be tear me ensnare me this be me die in your arm I cut you out ; now set me free lynch high above what use to be in her gallows build for me so I escape ; cut this noose around my neck I break free to see the thing you blind me and I shove you far away now I live the life I dream of you be dead to me and now I see it be you that be tear me ensnare me this be me die in your arm I cut you out ; now set me free you poison my life so I take this knife and I cut you out cut you out and now I see it be you that be tear me ensnare me this be me die in your arm I cut you out ; now set me free set me free ... set me free ________________________ name die in your Arms Artist trivium album ascendancy
