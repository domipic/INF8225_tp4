in the café of lost dream the night have no eye my fever have no heat and the shadow cure my hate a theatre of vision play in my head malarial consciousness now remedy old grayface , play a song for me a dissonant tune , a weird lilt damp neonlight fill the street I search for an anchor between monolithic tower of empty life Pour me a glass of amnesia Bleak your tooth of pure stone sway your arm of concrete flesh Search with eye of thousand soul your pipe vein in turmoil Bleak your tooth of pure stone sway your arm of concrete flesh Search with eye of thousand soul your pipe vein in turmoil rest your soul a little while in the café of lost dream an unspoken agony cool down the old devourer bereave a little Greenlight flow all riverlike A duke play a jazzy tune Glass-interspersed wall light up again as cloud unveil the moonlit path on which we all will walk one day __________________________ name café of lost dream Artist Todtgelichter album Angst
