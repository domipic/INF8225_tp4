you be build for blessing , but you only make them bleed , but you do n't care . and bruise be but shadow of the blackness that you breed , but you do n't care . the light that be leave inside their eye be darken day by day , but you do n't care . your presence pull the color from the world , ' till all be grey , but you do n't care . no , you do n't ' cause you be less than half a man , yellow belly and crimson hand . you will one day reap your reckoning , and maybe then you will understand . your hand be make to comfort , but they only conjure fear , but you do n't care . and she be in the closet pray , " Lord , please get me out of here , " but you do n't care . what mercy have they know from you , to ask that it be show to you ? __________________ name yellow belly artist thrice album Major Minor
