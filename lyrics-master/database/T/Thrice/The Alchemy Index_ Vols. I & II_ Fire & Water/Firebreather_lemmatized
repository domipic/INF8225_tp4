tell me , be you free , tell me , be you free ? in word or thought or deed tell me , be you free ? while the gallows stand bullet lance the brave lung we fold our hand and hold our tongue tell me , be you free ? when the fear fall on you tell me , be you free ? when the fear fall on you tell me , be you free , tell me , be you free ? in word or thought or deed tell me , be you free ? while the gallows stand bullet lance the brave lung will I fold my hand or hold my tongue ? or let the flame lick at my foot and breathe in fire and know I be free flame will rise and devour me to breathe in fire and know I be free __________________ name Firebreather Artist thrice album the alchemy index : Vols.
