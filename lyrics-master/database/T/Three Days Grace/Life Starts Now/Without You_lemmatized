what if I walk without you ? what if I run without you ? what if I stand without you ? I could not go on what if I live without you ? what if I love without you ? what if I die without you ? I could not go on you leave my side tonight and I , I just do n't feel right but I , I ca n't let you out of sight without you I be no one , I be nothing at all what if I lie without you ? and what if I rise without you ? and what if I dream without you ? I could not go on , no you leave my side tonight and I , I just do n't feel right but I , I ca n't let you out of sight without you , I be no one , I be nothing at all you leave my side tonight and I just do n't feel right I ca n't let you out of sight without you , I be no one , I be nothing at all you leave my side tonight ( my side tonight ) and I , I just do n't feel right ( do n't feel right ) but I , I ca n't let you out of sight without you , I be no one , I be nothing at all nothing at all _________________ name without You Artist Three Days Grace album Life start now
