stranger in a dark room laugh at joke they do n't quite hear frosted window pane and cheap champagne a face appear and anything could happen in these cathedral we roam where shadow people dance and trade their glance and walk home alone Staring out the window of the Roosevelt Hotel watch midtown empty out and I kiss her farewell they say we come from nothing and to nothing we will return and in between be gravity and bridge leave to burn _________________ name vampire artist the midnight album Endless Summer track no @card@ year @card@ MusicBrainz id 5ecaf4e8-c19d-4756-b697-20b8478b0c8c write by Tyler Lyle , Tim McEwan
