the second hand look like a knife . as it be count down the rest of our life . so hard to swallow . no step to follow . it become so hard to survive . dear youth , what be your one big plan ? you make us believe we have the world in our hand . we leave home with nowhere to go . face our fear as we brave the unknown . all I have to keep be these jaded old memory from scream of how it use be . I once be blind but now I can see that word of rationality be waste on me . so I say goodbye . it be just a memory , that have n't come to be . but I recognize that if you be on the right track but catch the wrong train , nothing end the same . dear youth , what be your one big plan ? you make us believe we have the world in our hand . we leave home with nowhere to go . face our fear as we brave the unknown . dear youth , put back those thought in my head . the one where I believe that I be boundless again . I know we be at the end of the road . this be our story , this be our home . we be unbreakable . alive and well . the day be shrink . alive and well . each moment more fleeting . alive and well . we give our good . alive . and well , you know the rest ... ; _________________________ name Dear Youth ( Day @card@ ) artist the ghost inside album Dear Youth ( Day @card@ )
