you leave some hope instill in me that I never should give up on anything I know this make you proud of me so this song remain for those who hurt like me . the man in black . he ride alone to a final destination unknown . the man in black . he ride alone : he be move on . not come home . I use to be the fearless one . live each day like death would never come now I feel his cold breath on my neck he be watch my step and tell me that I could be next . before I use to take these wing and I will fly so high ( I will fly so high . I try . ) now I live in regret never come down to say goodbye Oh why ca n't I ? the man in black . he ride alone to a final destination unknown . the man in black . he ride alone : he be move on . I ca n't follow . I use to be the fearless one . live each day like death would never come now I feel his cold breath on my neck he be watch my step and tell me that I could be next . so make way for the man in black so make way . he be never come back . I be so lose at sea Ryan , shine the light for me I be sink , I ca n't swim I need you here to pull me in I be so lose at sea Ryan , shine your light for me I be sink , I ca n't swim I miss you brother . you will never dim . _________________ name White Light Artist the ghost inside album get what you give
