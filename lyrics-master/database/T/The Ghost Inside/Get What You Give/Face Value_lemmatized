this will not be the new revival or a claim to fame . far away from the sling and arrow be where you go to pass your blame . it be the one with no courage that ca n't face the day . a captain with no ship be just a castaway . I send my heart out to sea . I send out my everything . a crown atop your head do not make you a king . a crowd that follow doe not mean you can lead . take this for what it be . we all know who be to blame . you be not go to find your place . you be just a face with no name . the weak prey on the weak , and I will be the first to say . that I do n't have all of the answer . sometimes I run away . but I set out on this course , continue with no remorse . I know who I be , and it be enough for me . I send my heart out to sea . I send out my everything . a crown atop your head do not make you a king . a crowd that follow doe not mean you can lead . take this for what it be . we all know who be to blame . you be not go to find your place . you be just a face with no name . I send my heart straight out sea . will it make its way back to me ? I have be so lose because all I have find be hatred and corruption . can my heart weather this storm ? and through the cold stay warm ? I say ! if it make its way back to me . I can survive anything . ________________ name Face Value Artist the ghost inside album get what you give
