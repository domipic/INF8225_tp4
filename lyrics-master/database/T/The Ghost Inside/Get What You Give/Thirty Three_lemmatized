I be lead to believe , but now I know for sure . when the wind be knock out of me . only one thing that can be cure and bring me to my foot . when all the word just relate . I just hit play , and when the record come to an end . I will listen all over again . truth be , I be take a step back and take some time to think . I have just get to express myself with this pen and ink . because I have get something leave to say . this mean all the world to me . these word never let me down . this all make me who I be . this be how I become a man . so when breath escape and my eye close . just hit play and when the record come to an end . I will sing all over again . truth be , I be take a step back and take some time to think . I have just get an express myself with this pen and ink . because I have get something leave to say . this mean all the world to me . these word never let me down . this be my everything . come do your bad , this be my obsession . I choose this life , and I have find m own direction . truth be , I be take a step back and take some time to think . I have just get an express myself with this pen and ink . because I have get something leave to say . this mean all the world to me . these word never let me down . when this record come to an end , I will just start it all over again . __________________ name thirty three artist the ghost inside album get what you give
