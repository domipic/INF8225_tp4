true dedication most just do not poss when push become shove , can you rise above the rest ? wave of word , they fall short and crash at my foot such be the way of the weak . " I be not scare ! " it be all that I know Done nothing but travel without know where to go I have be dig up bone remnant of what make up me that I have never show . this be my time to rise . dark horse . I will fight my way to the top . you will never be the thorn in my side dark horse . dream be my drive force open your eye . go live your own life . " I be not scare ! " it be all that I know Done nothing but travel without know where to go I have be dig up bone remnant of what make up me that I have never show . when the smoke clear , and the damage be do . I will be the only one leave standing I see someone without a shred of hope at their breaking point . at the end of the rope . " I be not scare ! " it be all that I know Done nothing but travel without know where to go I have be dig up bone remnant of what make up me that I will never show . ________________ name Dark Horse Artist the ghost inside album get what you give
