we look up to the sky , I swear it never end . walk down the road on any path we choose . but then something change , now day just be n't the same . I be feel so empty like part of me have be remove . my youth be get old . it get leave out in the bitter cold . now I put it on the back burner where it do n't belong . where do I go wrong ? let me stop to ask the question , " will I ever get the chance to repeat ? " I feel this more and more everyday . take me back to when I use to believe . nothing could prepare you , but we try our good . failure upon failure , what happen next ? nothing be ever easy and life still go on . do n't stop push on before you become withdraw . I have become withdraw . my youth be get old . it get leave out in the bitter cold . now I put it on the back burner where it do n't belong . where do I go wrong ? my innocence be go . where do I go wrong ? I feel it slip away from me . do you remember when we be free ? I have stand up on that ledge , and I know what you see : you be look over the edge and want to leap . I have write every word and express all my concern . you be lose that part of yourself , but it be n't mean to be . my youth be get old . it get leave out in the bitter cold . now I put it on the back burner where it do n't belong . where do I go wrong ? my innocence be go . ___________________ name slip away Artist the ghost inside album get what you give
