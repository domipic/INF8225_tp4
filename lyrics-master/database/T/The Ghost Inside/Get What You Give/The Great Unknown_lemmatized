sometimes we get so low Downsides be all we see your world be swallow whole and now you be all alone wait for me I put my faith in the one I trust to stick it out who never tuck their tail and run that be what friendship be all about . I be sick of wait for my life to come to me so I sing " I be not wait " you want to know how this all have come to be ? because I lean on the one beside me go and do what make you happy that be what I be say I be do wait for my life to come to me so I be head into the great unknown and I be not go alone . cast aside leave to fend for yourself your back be to the sun repeat your word over again " I do n't need anyone " in a world that want nothing more than to break me down I can take on anything with my true friend around you could never hold me down . I be sick of wait for my life to come to me so I be sing " I be not wait " you want to know how this all have come to be ? because I lean on the one beside me go and do what make you happy that be what I be say I be do wait for my life to come to me so I be head into the great unknown . I put my faith in the tried and true it be just you and me with nothing to lose keep those you trust right by your side only the strong will survive . I put my faith in the tried and true it be just you and me with nothing to lose I have the strong one by my side it be what be keep me alive . _______________________ name the great unknown artist the ghost inside album get what you give
