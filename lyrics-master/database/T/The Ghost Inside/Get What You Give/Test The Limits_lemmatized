I could tell you what you want to hear to hold you off another year . but I hope the truth find you well . a common praise . a pass phase . move forward ? not today ! the limit be in the sky , but will you be reach it tonight ? tonight you get to test the limit and tell yourself that . " I be alive ! " just make that choice and draw that line tonight . tonight you get to test the limit and tell yourself that , " I be alive , and I be not go anywhere ! " no chance to be free . no chance to soar in the sky . your foot fix to the ground . desperation be what be weigh you down . whether my strength be heaven send or my own self-confidence . these day when I be walk through a crowd . I do n't have to hold my head down . no more wasting time . burn bright like a star , ignite . the limit be in the sky but will you be reach it tonight ? tonight you get to test the limit and tell yourself that . " I be alive ! " just make that choice and draw that line tonight . tonight you get to test the limit and tell yourself that , " I be alive , and I be not go anywhere ! " " be a leader and never ever follow " that be what my father , that be what he always tell me . so with those word boldly speak , he send me down a long and hard road . shrug it off my shoulder , it be never mean for me . I wo n't waste my time in mediocrity . tonight I be alive . _____________________ name test the limit artist the ghost inside album get what you give
