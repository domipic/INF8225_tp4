we be so disconnect but not misdirect . they think that we be nothing , but I believe in something more . you watch the clock wind down and let the day go by . you justify the time you have spend , but all you do be make the rent . we will be bury with our memory , you will just be dead . I will live forever , you will just die in vain . no home , no bed . nowhere to hang my head . at the end of the day I hear no word they say . no home , no bed . nowhere to hang my head . I do n't care what they say ; I make a choice for me . we be so disconnect but not misdirect . so quick in pass judgment like I do n't belong . we will be bury with our memory , you will just be dead . I will live forever , you will just die in vain . no home , no bed . nowhere to hang my head . at the end of the day I hear no word they say . no home , no bed . nowhere to hang my head . I do n't care what they say ; I make the choice for me . but this time , I stand for this . there be no space between the line . I stand for this . no compromise this time . I stand for this . _____________ name outlive Artist the ghost inside album get what you give
