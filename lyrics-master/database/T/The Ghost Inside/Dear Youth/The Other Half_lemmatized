we believe in a system that have long be break . we turn the other cheek without a glimpse of emotion . always look out for number one . why do you need more while other have none ? measure my worth by what I have do , not what I have become . I span the ocean . I have see the sky . that be all I be ever gonna need to get by . my favorite thing in life , be n't even thing at all . nothing that drive my soul be even tangible . just because you want , do n't mean that you need . we have come so far from the life that we be mean to live . but there be so much more that I have leave to give . we always borrow time that ca n't be give back . we let it slip away and never pick up the slack . I span the ocean . I have see the sky . that be all I be ever gonna need to get by . my favorite thing in life , be n't even thing at all . nothing that drive my soul be even tangible . just because you want , do n't mean that you need . force feed and mislead . now we hang by a thread . force feed and mislead . but not me , I see red . you need to hear this . measure my worth by what I have do , not what I have become . be you listen ? measure my worth by what I have do , not what I have become . I have span the ocean . I have see the sky . that be all I be ever gonna need to get by . my favorite thing in life be n't even thing at all . but they be the thing that keep my heart full . ____________________ name the other half artist the ghost inside album Dear Youth
