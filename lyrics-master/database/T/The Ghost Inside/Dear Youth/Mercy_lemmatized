for whom the bell toll . there be a hurricane rage inside me . the second wave be right there behind me . do n't leave me alone , as this fire burn whole . before there be nothing leave to atone . breathe new life into me . send wave to crash right through me . I wear the perfect disguise , right behind my eye . its get me come undo . my facade make of stone . I be deep beneath now , I need to let go . this life have take it be toll . I ca n't be myself please everyone else . no ! first one up in line when there be hell to pay . filthy hand that never wash away . this be one time I wo n't be subjective . I need to see thing from a brand new perspective . because I be come undo . my facade make of stone . I be deep beneath , now I need to let go . this life have take it be toll . I ca n't be myself please everyone else . no ! I will like to think I will never cave in . a vicious battle I may never win . and I will like to think I will come out strong . Life be swing hard but I be swing harder . for whom the bell toll . " I have an inheritance from my father , it be the moon and the sun . and although that I roam all over the world , the spending be never do . " my facade make of stone . I be deep beneath , now I need to let go . this life have take it be toll . I ca n't be myself please everyone else . no ! ___________ name Mercy Artist the ghost inside album Dear Youth
