it appear that we ca n't rely on common sense . let be act our age and turn the page on this intolerance . because we be not mean to live like this . by-product of ignorance . this be out of control , it be out of control , it have gotta go . you be scare of what you do n't know . I will say this over again , and over again , until it end . a house divide will never stand . always fail to be accept cause hatred stem from uncertainty . speak down from above cast a shadow on the one in search of the sun . you think you be good than me ? your word of " wisdom " be spread disease . but you wo n't get the good of me . walk in these shoe before you trample my foot . this be out of control , it be out of control , it have gotta go . you be scare of what you do n't know . I will say this over again , and over again , until it end . a house divide will never stand . we tear each other down to build ourselves up . a system failure , enough be enough . " cause in a world this shaky and unstable , we have get to be less fuck hateful . " knuckle white . this be beyond aggression . knuckle white . because we need new direction . this be out of control , it be out of control , it have gotta go . you be scare of what you do n't know . I will say this over again , and over again , until it end . a house divide will never stand . this be out of control , it be out of control , it have gotta go . you be scare of what you do n't know . I will say this over again , and over again , until it end . a house divide will never stand . this be out of control . I will say this over again . a house divide will never stand . ____________________ name out of Control Artist the ghost inside album Dear Youth
