breathe in , breathe out . breathe . I will never be what you think I should be . no , not today . I will never say all the thing I should say . I be only human . more often than not , you be gonna feel alone . it be a long fall from the top . can you stand it ? give it all that I have get everywhere I roam . I ca n't do this alone , can you help me ? this be how it end . we fall , we mend . burn and start again . rebuild , forget . lest we forget . breathe in , breathe out . ___________________ name Phoenix flame artist the ghost inside album Dear Youth
