I leave behind this sentiment to the man that I will become . tell him not to be burden by the thing that I have do . the long day and endless night have become the routine . far beyond frustration . it be the end to all my mean . constantly incomplete . with my back against the wall , I stack brick by brick . I will rise above them all like this . I may not be forgive , but I forgive and I will forget . go through the motion be no way to exist . so if there be anybody out there that be so sick of feel alone , have the damage already be do ? you gotta get from underneath that gun . we walk before we run . with my back against the wall , I stack brick by brick . I will rise above them all like this . move me , choose me . please before you lose me . find me , drive me . end the thing that pride me . move me , improve me . ignite the flame that rule me . guide me , collide me . I need something to survive me . with my back against the wall . I will rise above them all like this . come back against all odd , I stack brick by brick . I will rise above them all like this . _____________ name move Me Artist the ghost inside album Dear Youth
