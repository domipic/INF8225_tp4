this be not a dream cause I be not asleep . I will need more than a metaphor if I want to earn my keep . my head be in cloud . my foot be on the ground . even if I fall I will always stand proud . I will carry my weight where brave dare go . through sleet , through rain , I will trail course unknown . I will carry my weight make sand out of stone . I will blaze this trail alone and take the long road . day in , day out , your heart be grow cold . your pry hand ca n't lift that chip off your shoulder . fade in , fade out , you fight with apathy . do n't cloud my vision when you be the one who ca n't see . I will carry my weight where brave dare go . through sleet , through rain , I will trail course unknown . I will carry my weight make sand out of stone . I will blaze this trail alone and take the long way home . I be always talk to myself because nobody would stick around . develop my own language and now I be the loud in the crowd . ( now I have to ) ask myself why they wanna stick around ? it be funny how they lift you up before they put you in the ground . remember those thing we be all mean to fear . and laugh as we realize they all get us here . I be the one . unfortunate sun . my death make a mark while your life fade away . I will carry my weight where brave dare go . through sleet , through rain , I will trail course unknown . I will carry my weight make sand out of stone . I will blaze this trail alone and take the long way home . I find strength where other find defeat . my eye be open as I push on . I use to always feel alone , but now I know I be not the only one . _______________ name Wide eye Artist the ghost inside album Dear Youth
