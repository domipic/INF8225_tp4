somewhere along the way we get throw off track . though we try so hard to keep ourselves in check . we have grow so use to this lack of sleep . exhaust from an overwhelming defeat . Whoa , I ca n't find my way . there be no path to guide me . the more I give in , the more it haunt me . and I have give up control . I suffer just to run with the wolf . so I sing these word to the fortunate . the one who look alive . never live life in disconnect , through someone else 's eye . Whoa , I ca n't find my way . there be no path to guide me . the more I give in , the more it haunt me . and I like a fool , be burn . I give and give with no return . Whoa , there be no path to guide me . the more I give in , the more it haunt me . and I have give up control . I suffer just to run with the wolf . nothing will be earn by skip stone . lesson wo n't be learn through break bone . one by one , we be lose ourselves . like a flame burn out , but I have a light . when you be in the dark and out of doubt , find me . God , what have I do ? I have lose myself for no one . Whoa , I ca n't find my way . there be no path to guide me . the more I give in , the more it haunt me . and I like a fool , be burn . I give and give with no return . Whoa , there be no path to guide me . the more I give in , the more it haunt me . and I have give up control . I suffer just to run with the wolf . _____________________ name with the wolf artist the ghost inside album Dear Youth
