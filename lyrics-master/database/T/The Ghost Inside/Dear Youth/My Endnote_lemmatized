consider this my endnote to be read when I be go . I have always be look for this , die for this , but it seem I have lose track . this be everything I believe in . this be what I will take back . we wo n't compete . I wo n't fight for a throne that do n't exist . we wo n't compete . everything we have be lose through arrogance . we wo n't compete . I wo n't fight for a throne that do n't exist . we wo n't compete . it be only us who feel the consequence . I choose to start today because I be long for a life less plague . where we both know , that if we both go , then we leave behind an empty page . why would I fight a war when I have lose everything I be fight for ? why do you turn your head when together we could wake the dead ? this be not beyond repair . this be a certainty . this be a must for me . because it be not beyond repair . we wo n't compete . I wo n't fight for a throne that do n't exist . we wo n't compete . everything we have be lose through arrogance . we wo n't compete . I wo n't fight for a throne that do n't exist . we wo n't compete . it be only us who feel the consequence . you ca n't break me . I have take the stand and I have earn my place . those who breed disgrace remain faceless . with my head hold high , I will give until I be go . you ca n't break me . with my head hold high , I have be here all along . you ca n't break me . ________________ name My Endnote Artist the ghost inside album Dear Youth
