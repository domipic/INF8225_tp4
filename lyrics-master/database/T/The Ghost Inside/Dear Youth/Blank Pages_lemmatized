we be from a long line of people run from themselves . Let 's look alive . the sun be block out from sight . all day turn to night . I be do run from myself . I speak for no one else . No. everyday in succession . until we come undo . Nah . this be me . this be you . yeah , we be come unglued . like a page pull from the bind . I ca n't stop scream these word over again . until breath escape and my chest cave in . it do n't matter where I have be . can n't give in , and shut down . just breathe in and breathe out and begin . I shake the hand of doubt so I could sever the line that he spit from his mouth . and now it be time to pull through . something I must do with or without you . what you see be what they want you to see . you have get to learn that for yourself and not from me . lesson learn in a lifetime . sleep with an open eye . what be yours ai n't mine . no matter what we be gonna pull through . just like we always do . yeah , ai n't that the truth . this be me . this be you . ride on a fault line . yeah , as we divide . I ca n't stop scream these word over again . until breath escape and my chest cave in . it do n't matter where I have be . can n't give in , and shut down . just breathe in and breathe out and begin . I shake the hand of doubt so I could sever the line that he spit from his mouth . and now it be time to pull through . something I must do with or without you . once more into the fray . once more do what be expect of me until it end . it end as it begin . then our work be do ... ; _________________ name Blank Pages Artist the ghost inside album Dear Youth
