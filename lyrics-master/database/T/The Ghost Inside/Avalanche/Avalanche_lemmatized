I ca n't stop scream these word over again . until breath escape and my chest cave in . it do n't matter where I have be . can n't give in , and shut down . just breathe in and breathe out and begin . I shake the hand of doubt so I could sever the line that he spit from his mouth . and now it be time to pull through . something I must do with or without you . I have be here one time , two time , now three time before . long enough not to wait around for that knock upon my door . I be stare at the face of doubt so I ca n't forget who I be cut out . why put in my all just to watch my building fall ? hey , hey , I be live for today . forget thing I ca n't change unwind me . hey , hey , nothing stand in my way . time stop when I break the chain that bind me . it all come down to this . both truth and consequence . I need something more than an empty promise . to believe in something , just one thing , that will never go wrong , not today . letdown after letdown , I be do . hey , hey , I be live for today . forget thing I ca n't change unwind me . hey , hey , nothing stand in my way . time stop when I break the chain that bind me . count the clock till the overhaul . you build a bomb inside my wall . count the clock till we be out of hand . you build , build now we be catch in the avalanche . reset , rebuild . you wreck this city but not my will . _______________ name avalanche artist the ghost inside album avalanche
