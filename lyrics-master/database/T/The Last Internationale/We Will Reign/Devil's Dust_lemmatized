every mornin ' head into the mine Breathin ' in that devil 's dust you put in all your time Doing what you must so the bill do n't fall behind you do n't need any help then and you wo n't be needin ' any now you get a load on your back a chain around your heart and a pride that be tearin ' us apart sometimes I wonder where be the dream we dream up and all the thing we want and the time that we lose to pull it back together all the night that I wait for you to come home and when you will do we have cuss and fuss it ai n't that I do n't love you it be cuz it be too much and I could n't tell you enough but we make it through all these year what do n't kill you only make you strong and baby I know Nothin 's really change only now we be a little old sometimes I wonder where be the dream we dream up and all the thing we want and the time that we lose to pull it back together pull it back together every day you come home a little more tired I hear you coughin ' All through the night always another year until you retire when the doctor say you be not alright you do n't need any help then surely you will be needin ' plenty now you get a load on your back Chain around your heart and a pride that be tearin ' us apart sometimes I wonder where be the dream we dream up and all the thing we want and the time that we lose to pull it back together and the time that we lose to pull it back together pull it back together __________________ name devil 's Dust Artist the last Internationale album we will reign write by the last Internationale
