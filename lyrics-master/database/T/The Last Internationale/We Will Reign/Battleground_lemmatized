all my life I have be fight fear Been drag and bury in this world alone the sound of thunder I could always hear have me feel so sick I call this hell my home I leave my love and everything behind I know where I be go wo n't be turn around until it break I be hold down the line ' til we be free from the march sound I know what be true I know what to do and I will see it ' til it be through hold your battleground where the hammer sound hold your battleground ' til the final round I be young and fearless with a fist of stone Learned to stand on my foot but this be not my land I have see my reflection and I be not alone we will take it all instead of what we can we know what be true we know what to do and we will defend it ' til it be through hold your battleground where the hammer sound hold your battleground ' til the final round until we be free we wo n't be move or be turn around until we be free we will keep on rise to the march sound the march sound ! hold your battleground where the hammer sound hold your battleground ' til the final round __________________ name battleground artist the last Internationale album we will reign write by the last Internationale
