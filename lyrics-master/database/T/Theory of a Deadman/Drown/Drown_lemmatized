ebb and flow , the sea be cold but my blood come to boil I feel it fill up my lung , the weight pull me to soil Current take me , breath escape me , induce coma sleep close my eye , I be paralyze , finally at peace another sunny day , I feel like get in the water why do you have to let me go ? such a perfect way to spend my time and swim out farther why do you have to let me drown ? drown ? lay there floating , body bloat , skin turnin ' to gray I build my castle , the dirty rascal finally get his way wave roll in and clean my sin , now everything be clear I be havin ' fun under the sun , wishin ' you be here another sunny day , I feel like get in the water why do you have to let me go ? such a perfect way to spend my time and swim out farther why do you have to let me drown ? drown ? a thousand league , I live and breathe along the ocean floor now submerse , I join the curse to float here evermore another sunny day , I feel like get in the water why do you have to let me go ? such a perfect way to spend my time and swim out farther why do you have to let me drown ? drown ? drown ? drown ? ___________ name Drown Artist theory of a Deadman album Drown
