we have get forever Slippin ' through our hand we have get more time to never understand Falling footstep weigh heavy on me behind darkness beneath candle whisper waltz around our dream the short distance between two point be the line from me to you foot turn black be this the path we must walk no turn back Wish i could just hear you talk can something like this be pull from under our foot leave our skin and burning coal to meet tell me now the short distance between two point be the line from me to you the short distance between two point be the line from me to you me to you _____________________________________ name between two Points ( feat .
