there be weight in the word we have say too heavy to carry in our head there be a chance that I think have go but here we be , play along I admit I be scared so fragile , emotionally impaired ( hopeless ) damaged good so break , so misunderstood ( wreckless and careless ) and I can see that rain cloud that follow me look like the one that follow you and the same ghost that keep me awake haunt your night just the same All dress up in black and grey we know each other just the same and every mile that sit between wo n't understand what it mean to have one look mean everything and throw all caution to the sea I have faith in us if we do n't self destruct ________________ name Face ghost Artist Touché Amoré album part the Sea between brightness and Me
