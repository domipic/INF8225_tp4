you can call this come clean or the repeat of what you know about the struggle I once have as I be learn to let go I make a pledge to myself if I be to raise my voice to be direct as I can be no matter what I may destroy but I ca n't say I have n't age I have outgrow what I use to be I wo n't fake what be expect to succeed with album three ( that be not me ) do this mean that the word wo n't come ? do this mean that I be at my end ? if my joy come with the price of my love I wo n't pay if I have to pretend there be always a chance to relapse and fall back to the person I still fear be there so if this ink will suddenly run out I will refill if I feel the need to share it be the fall of last year in New York City Day two of a tour , when my friend Johnny say " Hey , I will like you to meet Andy " we get to talk and connect on some thing mutual friend and how his band start write but then something be speak I know exactly what he mean I understand when he say " it be hard to write content " and it still be , and it still be but I wo n't take a step back though it might be for the good and it still be , and it still be I know you ask for some advice they use your blood to capitalize so give up all your secret to move unit , display your weakness you might spend some year alone at the price of forget your home so expose what hurt you the bad the exchange deal a handsome return ( be you in ? ) ______________________ name to write content Artist Touché Amoré album be survive by
