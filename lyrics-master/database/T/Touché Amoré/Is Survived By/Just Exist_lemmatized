I be once ask how I will like to be remember and I simply smile and say , " I will rather stay forever " it be possibly my loud cliché but feel good than just walk away I do n't know what my legacy will be a song , some word I write , or a kid I will never see all of these thing scare me half to death I will suffer the day just hope for the good but that be not to say I do n't think that all of this can change but that be not to say I wo n't wake up some day with a lion 's pride that I be gonna be okay if again I be ask how I will like to be remember next time I will be well prepare for the answer but you will never know much of the truth so I will just exist , it be all I can do so much to consider and too much to grasp to swallow mortality be enough of a task and leave your mark be just too much to ask I will just bow my head and leave out the back ________________ name just exist Artist Touché Amoré album be survive by
