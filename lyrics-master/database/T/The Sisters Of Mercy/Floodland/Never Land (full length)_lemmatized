and when your nerve break your thought and my word break your will and the heart break me over this wheel we be come down we fall Hand in hand in hand in hand we be come down we fall we be come down but we will never never land I have a face on the mirror I have a hand on the gun I have a place in the sun and a ticket to Syria I have everything within my reach I have money and stuff each and every call too much but never enough Tear it up and watch it fall we be come down we fall Hand in hand in hand in hand we be come down we fall we be come down but we will never never land with our back to the sky and our eye on the ground with the cloud far below no horizon around with the wind in our face and our arm open wide we will pass through this place to the other side all the day of our life all the way of our call follow ... I have a face on the mirror I have a hand on the gun I have a place in the sun and a ticket to Syria I have everything within my reach I have money and stuff each and every call too much but never enough Tear it up and watch it fall ______________________________ name Never Land ( full length ) artist the sister of Mercy album Floodland write by Andrew eldritch MusicBrainz id 6d295459-a7e3-4b3a-8a28-94e4051e76b8
