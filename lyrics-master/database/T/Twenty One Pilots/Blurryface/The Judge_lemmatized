I do n't know if this song be a surrender or a revel , I do n't know if this one be about me or the devil . you be the judge , oh no , set me free , oh no you be the judge , oh no , set me free , oh no I know my soul 's freezing , hell be hot for good reason , so please , Na na na na , oh oh Na na na na , oh oh Na na na na , oh oh _______________ name the Judge Artist twenty one Pilots album Blurryface
