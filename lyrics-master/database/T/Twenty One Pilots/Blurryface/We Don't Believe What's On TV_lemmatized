we do n't believe what be on TV , because it be what we want to see , and what we want , we know we ca n't believe , we have all learn to kill our dream . I need to know that when I fail you will still be here , ' Cause if you stick around I will sing you pretty sound , and we will make money sell your hair . I do n't care what be in your hair , I just want to know what be on your mind , I use to say , " I want to die before I be old , " but because of you I might think twice . alright , second verse what if my dream do not happen , would I just change what I have tell my friend , I do n't want to know who I would be , when I wake up from a dreamer 's sleep . I need to know that when I fail you will still be here , ' Cause if you stick around I will sing you pretty sound , and we will make money sell your hair . I do n't care what be in your hair , I just want to know what be on your mind , I use to say , " I want to die before I be old , " but because of you I might think twice . I do n't care what be in your hair , I just want to know what be on your mind , I use to say , " I want to die before I be old , " but because of you I might think twice . I do n't care what be in your hair , I just want to know what be on your mind , I use to say , " I want to die before I be old , " but because of you I might think twice . ___________________________________ name we do n't believe what be on TV Artist twenty one Pilots album Blurryface
