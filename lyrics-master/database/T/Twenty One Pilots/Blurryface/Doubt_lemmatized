scare of my own image , scare of my own immaturity , scare of my own ceiling , scare I will die of uncertainty , fear might be the death of me , fear lead to anxiety , do n't know what be inside of me . do n't forget about me , do n't forget about me , even when I doubt you , I be no good without you . temperature be drop , temperature be drop , I be not sure if I can see this ever stop , shake hand with the dark part of my thought , no , you be all that I have get , no. do n't forget about me , do n't forget about me , even when I doubt you , I be no good without you . gnaw on the bishop , claw our way up their system , repeat simple phrase , someone holy insist , I want the marking make on my skin , to mean something to me again , I hope you have n't leave without me , please . do n't forget about me , do n't forget about me , even when I doubt you , I be no good without you , no no no no Hey ! hey ! do n't forget about me , no Hey ! hey ! do n't forget about me , no Hey ! hey ! do n't forget about me , no Hey ! hey ! do n't forget about me , no ___________ name doubt Artist twenty one Pilots album Blurryface
