I wish I find some well sound no one be ever hear I wish I have a good voice that sing some good word I wish I find some chord in an order that be new I wish I do n't have to rhyme every time I sing I be tell when I get old all my fear would shrink but now I be insecure and I care what people think my name 's Blurryface and I care what you think my name 's Blurryface and I care what you think Wish we could turn back time , to the good ol ' day when our momma sing us to sleep but now we be stress out Wish we could turn back time , to the good ol ' day when our momma sing us to sleep but now we be stress out we be stress out sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I be young how come I be never able to identify where it be come from ? I will make a candle out of it if I ever find it try to sell it , never sell out of it , I will probably only sell one it will be to my brother , ' cause we have the same nose same clothes , home-grown , a stone 's throw from a creek we use to roam but it would remind us of when nothing really matter out of student loan and tree-house home , we all would take the latter my name 's Blurryface and I care what you think my name 's Blurryface and I care what you think Wish we could turn back time , to the good ol ' day when our momma sing us to sleep but now we be stress out Wish we could turn back time , to the good ol ' day when our momma sing us to sleep but now we be stress out use to play pretend , give each other different name we would build a rocket ship and then we will fly it far away use to dream of outer space but now they be laugh at our face say , " Wake up , you need to make money " , yeah we use to play pretend , give each other different name we would build a rocket ship and then we will fly it far away use to dream of outer space but now they be laugh at our face say , " Wake up , you need to make money " , yeah Wish we could turn back time , to the good ol ' day when our momma sing us to sleep but now we be stress out Wish we could turn back time , to the good ol ' day when our momma sing us to sleep but now we be stress out we use to play pretend , use to play pretend , money we use to play pretend , wake up , you need the money use to play pretend , use to play pretend , money we use to play pretend , wake up , you need the money use to play pretend , give each other different name we would build a rocket ship and then we will fly it far away use to dream of outer space but now they be laugh at our face say " Wake up , you need to make money " , yeah __________________ name stress out Artist twenty one Pilots album Blurryface
