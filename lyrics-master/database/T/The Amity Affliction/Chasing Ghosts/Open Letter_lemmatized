this be my open letter , this be something to remember . I wo n't be bury before my time , I be not search for forever , I have get my eye open wide , I have be search under rubble from the past , just look for a reason to make your life last . no need to look skyward for you to find hope , no need for redemption to be save from the rope , fuck no ! I be not search the sky for a reason to live ' cause I find beauty right here and the passion to give . so let me give you my heart , let me give you my tear , let me give you my life , let me give you my fear . just so you can hold on and sing while I do , sing these word out so loud , like I sing them for you . this be your open letter , something to remember , we can still keep on fight even though life be not forever . I be not search the sky for a reason to live ' cause I find beauty right here and the passion to give , so let me give you my heart , let me give you my tear , let me give you my life , let me give you my fear . this be my open letter , this be something to remember . this be my open letter , I be not search for forever . I be not search the sky for a reason to live ' cause I find beauty right here and the passion to give , so let me give you my heart , let me give you my tear , let me give you my life , let me give you my fear . one ... more ... time ! I be not search the sky for a reason to live ' cause I find beauty right here and find the passion to give , so let me give you my heart , let me give you my tear , let me give you my life , let me give you my fear . _________________ name Open Letter Artist the Amity affliction album chase ghost
