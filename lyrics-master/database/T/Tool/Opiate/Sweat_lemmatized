I be sweat , and breathing , and stare , and thinking , sink deep . and it be almost like I be swim . the sun be burn hot again on the hunter and the fisherman , and I be try to remember when , but it make me dizzy . seem like I have be here before . seem so familiar . seem like I be slip into a dream within a dream . must be the way you whisper . the sun be set cool again . I be the thinker and the fisherman and I be try to remember when but it make me dizzy . and I be sweat , and breathing , and stare , and thinking , sink deep . and it be almost like I be swim . seem like I have be here before . seem so familiar . seem like I be slip into a dream within a dream . it be the way you whisper . drag me under , it take me home ! seem like I have be here before . seem so familiar . seem like I be slip into a dream within a dream . it be the way you whisper . drag me under , it take me home . ___________ name Sweat Artist Tool album opiate write by Adam Jones , Daniel Carey , Maynard James Keenan , Paul D'Amour Copyright BMG Rights Management US , LLC
