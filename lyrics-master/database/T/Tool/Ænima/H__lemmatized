what be come through be alive what be hold up be a mirror but what be sing song be a snake look to turn my piss to wine they be both totally void of hate but kill me just the same the snake behind me hiss what my damage could have be my blood before me beg me open up my heart again and I feel this come over like a storm again considerately venomous voice , tempt me drain me , bleed me leave me cracked and empty drag me down like some sweet gravity the snake behind me hiss what my damage could have be my blood before me beg me open up my heart again and I feel this come over like a storm again now and I feel this come over like a storm again now I be too connect to you to slip away , fade away day away I still feel you touch me , change me considerately kill me considerately kill me considerately kill me considerately kill me without the skin here beneath the storm under these tear now the wall come down and as the snake be drown and as I look in his eye my fear begin to fade recall all of those time I could have cry then I should have cry then and as the wall come down and as I look in your eye my fear begin to fade recall all of the time I have die and will die it be all right I do n't mind I do n't mind I do n't mind I be too connect to you slip away , fade away day away I still feel you touch me , change me considerately kill me considerately kill me and considerately kill me ________ name H .
