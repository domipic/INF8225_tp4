well you know just what you do to me the way you move soft and slippery Cut the night just like a razor rarely talk and that be the danger it be the one thing you be my thing you know your voice be a love song it be a cat call from the past there be no ice in your lover walk you do n't look twice ' cause you move so fast it be the one thing you be my thing you have get a dozen man behind you you have get dead flower on the floor you be too pretty in the daylight it keep them come back for more it be the one thing you be my thing it be the one thing you be my thing it be the one thing you be my thing ___________________ name the one Thing Artist INXS album Shabooh Shoobah write by Andrew Charles Farriss , Michael Hutchence Copyright Universal Music Publishing Group
