and if you be take a walk through the garden of life what do you think you will expect you would see ? just like a mirror reflect the move of your life and in the river reflection of me just for a second , a glimpse of my father I see and in a movement , he beckon to me and in a moment , the memory be all that remain and all the wound be reopen again we be blood brother we be blood brother we be blood brother we be blood brother and as you look all around at the world in dismay what do you see , do you think we have learn not if you be take a look at the war-torn affray out in the street where the baby be burned we be blood brother we be blood brother we be blood brother we be blood brother there be time when I feel I be afraid for the world there be time I be ashamed of us all when you be float on all the emotion you feel and reflect the good and the bad Will we ever know what the answer to life really be ? can you really tell me what life be ? maybe all the thing that you know that be precious to you could be sweep away by fate 's own hand we be blood brother we be blood brother we be blood brother we be blood brother when you think that we have use all our chance and the chance to make everything right keep on make the same old mistake make untipping the balance so easy when we be live our life on the edge say a prayer on the book of the dead we be blood brother we be blood brother we be blood brother we be blood brother we be blood brother we be blood brother we be blood brother we be blood brother and if you be take a walk through the garden of life ____________________ name Blood Brothers Artist Iron Maiden album brave New World
