fade away from here I be fade away from here I be fade away from here we be fade away from here I be fade away from here , ca n't see nothing here . even though I be awake , my body slowly break . feel so cold that I shake , every time I reflect . these story I be write to verse they sure do serve my thirst . seem to clear my head , when I be awake at night . I pull myself so tight , lie in the dark . feel rich with word , I be about to draw my thought , re plan out my chord . I will start it all from scratch . take me away , shatter my hope today . nothing keep me on my seat . oh it end so tragically for me . take me away ... . _____________________ name serve my thirst artist infected mushroom album army of mushroom
