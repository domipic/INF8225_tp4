why ca n't I see what be in front of me ? why ca n't I see what be in front of me ? I see the door that I ca n't open add lock from time to time when it open something block me and I be ask myself why ? do I take the step I want be it just a state of mind ? I feel sorry for myself every time I close my eye and I fall into a hole and I can take no more ... and I fall into a hole and I can take no more ... and I fall into a hole and I can take no more ... and I fall into a hole and I can take no more ... why ca n't I see what be in front of me ? why ca n't I see what be in front of me ? what be behind the door I wonder ? must be bright than my past will I feel a little different when I take myself across ? be it really worth the journey ? be it just a foolish task ? I feel sorry for myself when I open up my eye ... and I fall into a hole and I can take no more and I fall into a hole and I can take no more and I fall into a hole and I can take no more and I fall into a hole and I can take no more ... . ____________________ name in Front of Me Artist infected mushroom album vicious Delicious
