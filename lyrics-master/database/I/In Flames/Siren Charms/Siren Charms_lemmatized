how far until the edge ? these wrong way be mine but the whole world can just go to hell this life be kill me my feeling inside I ca n't explain I be awake , but not for long the hope be still not go somewhere behind the cloud I will set you free if you follow me Reach out touch the hand of God I give you the story of my life some of my precious time but I be tire of this with every promise of eternal light another feeling die the hope be still not go somewhere behind the cloud I will set you free if you follow me Reach out touch the hand of God the hope be still not go somewhere behind the cloud I will set you free if you follow me Reach out touch the hand of God I will set you free if you follow me Reach out touch the hand of God __________________ name Siren charm artist in flame album Siren charm
