I be right here when the world explode try to remember these word when the world explode ! in the dark of night you be my endless fire inside across the water and back to shore through space in time , you guide me afraid there be not much time life be a matter of moment Face the truth that I can run I always know so if I never get to say this to you you should still know , dry your eye find a stream that lead toward the water of the divine come lie with me Face the truth , that I can run I always known ( I always know ) so if I never get to say this to you you should still know , dry your eye find a stream that lead toward the water of the divine come lie with me ( lay with me ) so if I never get to say this to you you should still know Dry your eye ... dry your eye find a stream that lead toward the water of the divine come lie with me _____________________________ name when the World explode artist in flame album Siren charm
