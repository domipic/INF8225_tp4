a vanish light the end of a compromise a fury and rage a dream will be manage beyond get them in line Learn to survive a fine way to make friend and a place to call home take a picture and Jump before we crash take a picture and Jump before we crash we will slide away and Learn your way we will fire when ready this be the race to no man land but in no set direction you be on the easy route money a front , theres no doubt take a picture and Jump before we crash take a picture and Jump before we crash we will slide away and Learn your way we will fire when ready this be the race to no man land but in no set direction its so , so sad but pay no mind take a picture and Jump before we crash take a picture and Jump before we crash we will slide away and Learn your way we will fire when ready this be the race to no man land but in no set direction _____________________ name vanish Light Artist in flame album come Clarity
