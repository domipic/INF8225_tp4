it be not so much the pain it be more the actual knife pretend the picture be perfect I cut myself to sleep I close my eye for a second and meet the fragile soul I scream to hide that I be lonely the echo call my name if I ever , if I never make me understand the thought , whatever make me see , make me be make me understand you be there for me take this life , I be right here Stay a while and breathe me in take this life , I be right here Stay a while and breathe me in the raindrop just beg to hit me what now ? have n't rain for day no time to play hide-and-seek I call on you to take me on break me down to piece put me back , do it right this time struggle to fill this empty shell Burn my effort in the end , it mean nothing if I ever , if I never make me understand the thought , whatever make me see , make me be make me understand you be there for me take this life , I be right here Stay a while and breathe me in take this life , I be right here Stay a while and breathe me in these thought Burn a hole in my heart these thought will keep me feel these thought Burn a hole in my heart these thought will keep me feel if I ever , if I never make me understand the thought , whatever make me see , make me be make me understand you be there for me take this life , I be right here Stay awhile and breathe me in take this life , I be right here Stay awhile and breathe me in ____________________ name take this Life Artist in flame album come Clarity
