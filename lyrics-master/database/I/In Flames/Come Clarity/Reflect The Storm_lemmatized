shoot for shot let the bullet penetrate me embrace me tell me story of golden god the precision in your voice pierce the wall that I have build your eye reach deep in me take a chance they do n't come much big than this A Dark Star spend another day with me a dead surface that do n't reflect the storm underneath take a chance Bring me the calm when there be nothing expose the dark side ache and emotional expose the dark side impossible to tame away from the light of the sun away I find what be really me throw yourself into the eye of chaos infiltrate me sneak out before I awake take out the trash and burn it try to find a beautiful place to lay these fragile bone of mine away from the light of the sun away I find what be really away from the light of the sun away I find what be really me when there be nothing expose the dark side ache and emotional expose the dark side impossible to tame away from the light of the sun away I find what be really away from the light of the sun away I find what be really away from the light of the sun away I find what be really me _______________________ name reflect the Storm Artist in flame album come Clarity
