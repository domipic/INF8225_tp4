you want someone to blame the one who drive the rust nail but who be leave will never care pretend become a chore all you search for , a little piece of mind too far , too deep , the two face smile so lose , you feel , I know Wide awake but still asleep always a stranger in a crowd ( sleep , sleep , sleep ) Wide awake , always a stranger in a crowd ( Wake , wake , wake ) just this once listen to the word I say if you want I will I be there until the end of time leave the doom behind Search with different light you be try to remember but it be all make believe you be , you be , you be Wide awake but still asleep ( Wide awake but still asleep ) always a stranger in a crowd just this once listen to the word I say if you want I will I be there until the end of time just this once listen to the word I say if you want , I be there just this once listen to the word I say if you want I will I be there until the end of time _________________ name rust Nail Artist in flame album rust Nail
