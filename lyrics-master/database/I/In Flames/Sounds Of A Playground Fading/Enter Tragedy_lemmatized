twisting tongue Fallen off the edge again need some space need disgrace I be confused I be in a maze I need for you to pick me up when I fall down there be so much more we can go far but I ca n't control my selfish way Enter tragedy slash my soul why be it part of the plan ? do you question me ? I question you who be the man in front of me ? ( who be the man in front of me ? ) I be blindfold , I ca n't see need a reason , I be leave empty there be so much more we can go far but I ca n't control my selfish way Enter tragedy slash my soul why be it part of the plan ? do you question me ? I question you this inner apathy bring me to life I know it be strange and it be drain me I be tired I be feed up I be a slave I be tired I be feed up I be a slave Enter tragedy slash my soul why be it part of the plan ? do you question me ? I question you ___________________ name Enter tragedy artist in flame album sound of a playground fading
