I say goodbye to you all at once do n't dare to face you all alone I go from wreckage to world class with a box of T-shirt and some record to sell but time have change I have to defend my action the foundation crumble and I have to leave thanks for everything I could n't ask for more I say " I love you all " as I vanish through the Jester 's door ___________________ name Jester 's Door Artist in flame album sound of a playground fading
