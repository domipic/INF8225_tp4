until the world cease to move that burning feeling let me go this be real always one more thing I clench my hand and bang my head take whatever come to you all the while , I do n't need another friend I burn when I do the thing I do for you forever the night it be all for me now I be sure that one day I can get you all that you lose I never tell bless be the sick in me I be die alone we stand to fight for nothing without a thought , a reason it will never be okay I burn when I do the thing I do for you forever the night it be all for me now I be sure that one day I can get you all you lose a grow pain it be hard to say what bring the dark burden for some of us there be no answer chain be break I wo n't let this build up inside me there be a storm come but I will serve no more ' till my very last breath I burn when I do the thing I do for you forever the night it be all for me now I be sure that one day I can get you all you lose ________________ name all for Me Artist in flame album sound of a playground fading
