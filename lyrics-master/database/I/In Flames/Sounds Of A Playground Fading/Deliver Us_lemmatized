remind me I be golden the fortress above the sun why do n't you spend nowhere with me follow the river and the path of the one write out name on the shore forever I ca n't find struggle in a world undefined decide how you want it to be I be not eternity Fly into the distant disappear for awhile I ca n't make sense of this but we be here today feel alive it start to fall apart let me take control ( reminisce ) the day and nothing more something I will find again ( deliver U ) can n't hear the word you say but it do n't really matter I give the world to you if you just Fly into the distant disappear for awhile I ca n't make sense of this but we be here today feel alive Fly into the distant disappear for awhile I ca n't make sense of this but we be here today alive ________________ name deliver us artist in flame album sound of a playground fading
