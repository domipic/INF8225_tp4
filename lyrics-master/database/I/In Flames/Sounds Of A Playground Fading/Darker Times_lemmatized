September be here again every insecurity remind you who be at the helm ? dark time with fear in the eye who be the man in charge ? invent isolation alone and safe inside struggle with word that make sense in time yet wait for someone to enter say , I have a good plan I have a good plan I have a good plan never have to worry for all that we know truth be tell as we lie down low walk the thin line let the happiness in for now it be fine we be live the lie when light break another way to matter all question somehow answer when life come crush at the early break of day we have only come so far never have to worry for all that we know truth be tell as we lie down low walk the thin line let the happiness in for now it be fine we be live the lie ( never have to worry for all that we know ) ( truth be tell ) as we lie down low walk the thin line let the happiness in for now never have to worry for all that we know truth be tell as we lie down low walk the thin line let the happiness in for now it be fine we be live the lie __________________ name dark Times artist in flame album sound of a playground fading
