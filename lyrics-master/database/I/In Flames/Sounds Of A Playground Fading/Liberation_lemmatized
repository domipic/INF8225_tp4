I know what it take to break you you know I never sleep just because you make them think do n't mean the world will fall into place take some time but now you know tomorrow be too late close your eye walk with me I set you free and everything you ask for I find the way and I will return here soon I have to see those who do n't know rest in peace , I be come for you and I will be , I will be with you tonight if today be your last day would that change a thing ? you probably believe what you tell them live each moment like your last close your eye , walk with me , I set you free and everything you ask for I find the way and I will return here soon I have to see those who do n't know rest in peace , I be come for you and I will be , I will be with you tonight ________________ name Liberation Artist in flame album sound of a playground fading
