big picture slowly fade Walls be close in and there I be curse the ground unable to understand I wo n't let the world break me so I need to change direction nothing special and far from perfect light the way for me feel I be run an endless mile last candle burn and I be die inside all of this will turn to ash a change for a peace of mind walking where the dead ship dwell these be shore I leave behind Streets be get small and I have to leave feel I be run an endless mile last candle burn and I be die inside all of this will turn to ash a change for a peace of mind all I hear be noise heart of false hope Guess I take it all for grant I know I go too far I wo n't say I be sorry I get what I deserve I get what I deserve feel I be run an endless mile last candle burn and I be die inside all of this will turn to ash a change for a peace of mind feel I be run an endless mile last candle burn and I be die inside all of this will turn to ash a change for a peace of mind ________________________________ name where the Dead ship dwell artist in flame album sound of a playground fading
