you can find all you need the message be in the silence whisper word to calm your mind Reach inside numb the pain come around with answer we be ghost of a concrete world genetic code of a die breed will I be leave behind ? sound of a playground fade Staring into bright light I be what I have do it be useless to hide an empty chamber Guess I be part of a plan we be ghost of a concrete world genetic code of a die breed will I be leave behind ? sound of a playground fade we be run out of time can n't seem to recognize what put us here in the first place count down the day begin of the end we be ghost of a concrete world genetic code of a die breed will I be leave behind ? we be ghost of a concrete world genetic code of a die breed will I be leave behind ? ___________________________________ name sound of a playground fade artist in flame album sound of a playground fading
