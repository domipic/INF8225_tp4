I dream that you have die I be forever alone I be weak and I be frighten this bring about a change thing you say to me believe and thing you might find will turn into a march I stand along and breath again I wo n't stop until this be through and I ca n't wait to see the sun rise again it be moment like this I be what you will never be to better what I be you wo n't hear lie from me feel a sudden haze time to get moving get somewhere with no direction I swear to you it will never be the same it be not straight but the road lie open leave all tear behind I stand along and breath again I wo n't stop until this be through and I ca n't wait to see the sun rise again it be moment like this I be what you will never be to better what I be you wo n't hear lie from me and I ca n't wait to see the sun rise again it be moment like this I be what you will never be to better what I be you wo n't hear lie from me erase darkness from from my mind last remain night from here to everywhere I stand along and breath again I wo n't stop until this be through and I ca n't wait to see the sun rise again it be moment like this I be what you will never be to better what I be you wo n't hear lie from me ________________ name a New Dawn Artist in flame album sound of a playground fading
