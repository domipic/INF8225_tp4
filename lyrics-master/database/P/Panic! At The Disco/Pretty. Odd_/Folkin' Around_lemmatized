allow me to exaggerate a memory or two where summer be last longer than long than we do when nothing really matter except for me to be with you but in time we all forget and we all grow your melody sound as sweet as the first time it be sing with a little bit more character for show and by the time your father be hear of all the wrong you have do then I be put out the lantern find your own way back home if I have forget how to sing before I sing this song I will write it all across the wall before my job be do and I will even have the courtesy of admit I be wrong as the final word before I be dead and go you have never be so divine in accept your defeat and I have never be more scare to be alone if love be not enough to put my enemy to sleep then I be put out the lantern find your own way back home ____________________ name Folkin ' around artist panic ! at the disco album Pretty . odd .
