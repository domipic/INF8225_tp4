a daydream spill from my corked head break free of my wooden neck leave to nod over sleep wave like bob bait for bath cod floating flock of candle swan slowly drift across wax pond the man all play along to march drum and boy do they have fun behind the sea they sing , ( Hey ! ) " so our match leg be march clock and we be all too small to talk to god yes , we be all too smart to talk to god " toast the fine folk cast silver crumb to us from the dock jinx thing ring as they leak through tiny crack in the boardwalk scarecrow now it be time to hatch sprout sun and ageless daughter ( do n't you know ? ) do n't you know ? that those watermelon smile just ca n't ripen underwater just ca n't ripen underwater the man all play along to march drum and boy do they have fun behind the sea they sing , ( Hey ! ) " so our match leg be march clock and we be all too small to talk to god yeah , we be all too smart to talk to god Oh , we be all too smart to talk to god " Legs of wood wave , wave of wooden leg wave of wooden leg Legs of wood wave , wave of wooden leg wave of wooden leg Legs of wood wave , wave of wooden leg wave of wooden leg Legs of wood wave , wave of wooden leg wave of wooden leg ____________________ name behind the Sea Artist panic ! at the disco album Pretty . odd .
