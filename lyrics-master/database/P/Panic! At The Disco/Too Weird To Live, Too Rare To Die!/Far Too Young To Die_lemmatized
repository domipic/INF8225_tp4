I never so adore you I be twist allegory now I want to complicate you do n't let me do this to myself I be chase roller coaster I have get to have you closer now Endless romantic story you never could control me well , I never really think that you will come tonight when the crown hang heavy on either side give me one last kiss while we be far too young to die we be far too young to die we be far too young to die fixation or psychosis ? devote to neurosis now Endless romantic story you never could control me well I never really think that you will come tonight when the crown hang heavy on either side give me one last kiss while we be far too young to die well , I never really think that you will come tonight when the crown hang heavy on either side give me one last kiss while we be far too young to die we be far too young to die we be far too young to die well , I never really think that you will come tonight when the crown hang heavy on either side give me one last kiss while we be far too young to die we be far too young to die __________________________ name Far Too Young to die artist panic ! at the disco album too weird to live , too rare to die !
