place in a smile at the perfect event , grace your skin with the side of my hand . if I ever leave I could learn to miss you with sentimental boy as my nom de plume . let me save you of this wrong . I may never sleep tonight , as long as you be still burn bright . if I could trade mistake for sheep , Count me away before you sleep . I will stay awake till I trade my mistake , so they fade away . I fill the room in this body , desert , my organ can go on without me . you ca n't fly these wing . you ca n't sleep in this box with me . let me save you of this wrong . I may never sleep tonight , as long as you be still burn bright . if I could trade mistake for sheep , Count me away before you sleep . I will stay awake till I trade my mistake , so they fade away . do n't let me trade you of this wrong , then I will pull you in . cause I be an anchor , save her oar feel it sink in . let me save you of this wrong I be an anchor , sink on . I may never sleep tonight , as long as you be still burn bright . if I could trade mistake for sheep , Count me away before you sleep . I will stay awake till I trade my mistake , so they fade away . ____________________ name Trade mistake artist panic ! at the disco album vice & virtue
