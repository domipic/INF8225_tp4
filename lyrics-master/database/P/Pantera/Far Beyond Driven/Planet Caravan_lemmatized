we sail through endless sky Stars shine like eye the black night sigh the moon in silver tree Falls down in tear light of the night the earth , a purple blaze of sapphire haze in orbit always while down below the tree bath in cool breeze silver starlight break down the night and so we pass on by the crimson eye of great god Mars as we travel the universe ____________________ name planet caravan Artist Pantera album far beyond drive
