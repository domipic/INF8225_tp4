dear sky ... dear sky do n't cry for me , cry for me , be the hope I could never reach . cold sea please do n't let me sink , do n't let me sink , Wrap your arm around me and carry me home . I stand at the shore and speak to the ocean I stand in the water and let my gut spill I say , " you and me , we be not so different I see my reflection in all that you do ... " we both keep our secret we be both , oh , so blue my heart be full of darkness I know that yours be too ... I sit on the rooftop and scream at the sky I sit on the edge until I know deep inside like the sky , I will always be empty the horizon , my love - forever just out of reach . we both keep our secret we be both , oh , so blue my heart be full of darkness I know that yours be too ... Distance be bear when the sea and the sky grow apart loneliness be bear the day I let you go ! I let you go ! I let you , I let you , I let you go ! I let you , I let you go ! I let you go ! so now I stand at the shore and speak to the ocean I stand in the water and let ... let my gut spill ! let my gut spill ! we both keep our secret we be both , oh , so blue my heart be full of darkness I know , I know that yours be too ! dear sky ... dear sky do n't cry for me , cry for me , be the hope I could never reach Cold sea please do n't let me sink , do n't let me sink , Wrap your arm around me and carry me home . dear sky ! _______________________ name Blue and the Grey Artist Parkway Drive album atlas
