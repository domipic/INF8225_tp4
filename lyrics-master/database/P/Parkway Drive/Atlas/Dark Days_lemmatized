what will you tell your child when they ask you : " what go wrong ? " how can you paint a picture of a paradise lose to eye that know only a wasteland ? how will you justify ? justify - watch the world die ? the clock be tick , ca n't you feel our day be number Head first into disaster from which there will be no return with narrow mind , we decimate our one true home Cast into oblivion , judgment be call . behold the pale horse this be the funeral of the Earth behold the pale horse this be the funeral . the blind eye can no longer be cast the clock be tick , there be no second chance . the blind eye can no longer be cast there will be no future if we ca n't learn from our mistake the clock be tick , there be no second chance there will be no future if we ca n't learn . a force extinction close out the age of apathy the final act - sacrifice the world 's ecology the death of beauty , the death of hope Cast before the throne of avarice , judgment be call . behold the pale horse this be the funeral of the Earth behold the pale horse this be the funeral . the blind eye can no longer be cast there will be no future if we ca n't learn from our mistake the clock be tick , there be no second chance there will be no future , if we ca n't learn . I ca n't watch it burn ! I ca n't watch it burn ! I ca n't watch it burn ! I ca n't watch it burn ! I ca n't watch it burn ! I ca n't watch it burn ! I ca n't watch it burn ! behold the pale horse ! _______________ name Dark Days Artist Parkway Drive album atlas
