do you remember all those night when we stand side by side and we say " we will save the goodbye " the night be young we still have time . in my dream I see it end I see , I see the sky descend and I let the sadness empty from my heart Cause in my dream I feel I be fall and I hear the darkness calling do n't wake me up until the morning 's light . because I have never feel more alive ! do you remember all those night when we stand side by side and we say " we will save the goodbye " the night be young ... well I never , never , never want to press rewind every mistake that lead us here I would n't change for anything . I would n't change for anything . I would n't change for anything . dear girl , there be a world that stand between us and them see , this be never about give up - just give in because you only live once but you spend your whole life die so when it all come crash know you be not alone you be not alone ... you only live once but you spend your whole life die so when it all come crash know you be not alone . you be not alone ... you only live once but you spend your whole life die so when it all come crash know you be not alone . alone , alone , alone ! we welcome death with all our sin there be no fear when this life end we welcome death with all our sin there be no fear when this life end we welcome death with all our sin there be no fear ! there be no fear ! do you remember ? do you remember ? do you remember all those night when we stand side by side and we say " we will save the goodbye " the night be young ... do you remember all those night when we stand side by side and we say " we will save the goodbye " the night be young . we still have time . cause I have never feel more alive I have never feel more alive . alive , alive , alive ! _______________ name dream run Artist Parkway Drive album atlas
