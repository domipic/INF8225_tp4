my life be a weathered down shipwreck splitting at the seam , hold together by memory and dream every face I have see , a stitch on my mind on a shadow of a dream , of a dream . and my heart be its cargo , a worn out old thing Been drag around this rock more time than you will believe to the east I call home but the west , she be call from the north , to the south . forever I be drift away with more hope than fear put your head to my chest and you will hear ... the sound of it beat be the sound of love leave the sound of it beat be the sound of the emptiness flood in . flood in ... flood in ... it be the sound of the emptiness flood in . my life , it ache my heart , it break and I ca n't shake the feeling all I be be sink . where one thousand eye stare back at me but the one that I will die for be the one who ca n't see . one thousand eye stare back at me but the one that I will die for be the one who ca n't see . flood in ... flood in ... flood in ... it be the sound of the emptiness . ___________ name Atlas Artist Parkway Drive album atlas
