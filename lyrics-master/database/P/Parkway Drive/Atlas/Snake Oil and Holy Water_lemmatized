you want a piece of my mind ? there be no peace to find ! this be all of your doubt , repay in kind I be alone in crowded room I be a ghost in forgotten tomb widow maker , you be no company to keep . cause you can fool some people , sometimes but you ca n't fool the world for the rest of your life you can fool some people , sometimes but you ca n't fool the world ... nobody notice ! nobody care ! the curtain fall to no one , nowhere nobody notice ! nobody care ! as the curtain fall ... soulless - spineless Cut from the beggar 's cloth you fill your skull with their shit till it run from your mouth . heartless - carcass I have see more life in dead man 's eye I have hear more truth alone with the night . and I will rather believe in nothing than believe in a fuck lie ! I will sooner fail one thousand time than regret I never try ! cause you can fool some people , sometimes but you ca n't fool the world for the rest of your life you can fool some people , sometimes but you ca n't fool the world ... you ca n't fool us all ! you howl at the world , but speak a dead language you be sell your soul , but no one be buy you pray to your god of fashion and industry Heads in the cloud , but you live on your fuck knee . on your knee ! nobody notice ! nobody care ! the curtain fall to no one , nowhere nobody notice ! nobody care ! as the curtain fuck fall ... soulless - spineless Cut from the beggar 's cloth you fill your head with their shit till it run from your mouth . heartless - carcass I have see more life in dead man 's eye I have hear more truth alone with the night . alone with the night ! no ! no peace to find ! ______________________________ name snake Oil and Holy Water Artist Parkway Drive album atlas
