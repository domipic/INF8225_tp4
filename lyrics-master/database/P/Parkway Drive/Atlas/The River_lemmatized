follow your heart to the water Fill your pocket with stone throw your arm around me never let me go . you be the first - you would n't be the last what the river take , we could never replace and as the pain set in , so do the realization you be never come home . for night we lay awake wish for answer , hope against all hope and if love could change the course of fate these night , we move mountain . but as the news filter down the line the impact shake us Shook us to the core loss strike like a dagger in our ache heart . so follow your heart to the water Fill your pocket with stone throw your arm around me never let me go . it be not the year in your life , it be not the year in your life , it be not the year in your life , it be the life in your year ! old soul , so it be say ... the day we lose be the day I find regret not in the water that embrace you but in the wake your absence leave . sink into me ! sink into me ! hold out your hand Sink into me hold out your hand I will take you away . hold out your hand Sink into me hold out your hand I will take you away . hold out your hand Sink into me hold out your hand I will take you away . hold out your hand , sink into me hold out your hand , I will take you away hold out your hand surrender the weight of this world . follow your heart to the water Fill your pocket with stone throw your arm around me ... follow your heart to the water Fill your pocket with stone throw your arm around me never let me go . never let me go . never let me go . never let me go . _______________ name the River Artist Parkway Drive album atlas
