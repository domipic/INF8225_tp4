bear of dust and stone Dead heart , roam a die home life leave us all White bone upon the shore of time we be but spark in a darken world and yet some thing be bear to burn . the napalm in your eye be all my cold heart need if you bring the match ... I will bring the gasoline ! I be the same bad news as you you be the same kind of " fuck " as me I be the same bad news as you you be the same , you be the same as me ! ____________ name Sparks Artist Parkway Drive album atlas
