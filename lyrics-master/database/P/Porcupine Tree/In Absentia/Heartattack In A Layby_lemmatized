I pull off the road East of Baldock and Ashford feel for my cell in the light from the dashboard hiss from the road the smell of rain in the air con maybe check the news or just put a tape on Lighting up a smoke I have get this feeling inside me do n't feel too good if I close my eye and fall asleep in this layby would it all subside the fever push the day by Motor window wind I could do with some fresh air can n't breathe too well ( she wait for me ) I guess I should go now ( Home wait for me ) she be wait to make up ( she wait for me ) to tell me she be sorry ( Home wait for me ) and how much she miss me ( she wait for me ) I guess I be just burn out ( Home wait for me ) I really should slow down ( she wait for me ) I be perfectly fine but ( Home wait for me ) I just need to lie down ( she wait for me ) we will grow old together ( she wait for me ) we will grow old together ( she wait for me ) we will grow old together ... ____________________________ name Heartattack in a Layby Artist porcupine tree album in absentia
