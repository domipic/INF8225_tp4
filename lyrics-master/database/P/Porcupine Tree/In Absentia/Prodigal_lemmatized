I do n't know whose side I be on I do n't think that I belong ' round here if I leave the stage would that be wrong ? I try to find myself a good way I get religion but I go astray they take my money and I lose my faith Rain keep crawl down the glass the good time never seem to last close your eye and let the think pass I try the capsule and I try the smoke I try to aid escape like normal folk but I never seem to get the joke Rain keep crawl down the glass the good time never seem to last close your eye and let the thought pass ( close your eye and let it pass ) these be my old clothes this be a new low this be my blood flow this be my headstone I spend the day with all my friend they be the one on whom my life depend I be gonna miss them when the series end Rain keep crawl down the glass ( pull yourself together ) the good time never seem to last ( you know it be not so bad ) close your eye and let the thought pass ( close your eye and let it pass ) ______________ name prodigal Artist porcupine tree album in absentia
