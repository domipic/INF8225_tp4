every night the dream be always the same can n't escape these wall of dark decay feel me drown underneath the wave every time it never seem to change take you away and now they be gonna get it , all I have you know now you be go and I just want to have you back again Hollow heart be all I have today someone come and pull away the vein they stitch it up and put me on display but nothing seem to cure me of the pain take you away and now they be gonna get it , all I have you know now you be go and I just want to have you back again take you away _______________________________ name Venger ( feat .
