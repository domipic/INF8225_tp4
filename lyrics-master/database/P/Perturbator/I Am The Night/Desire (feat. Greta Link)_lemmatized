we gotta get away and disappear we be run out of time the sun be low we will go and break away fade into the light they will sell your soul just so you will make believe you be live in a lie you never know the way you be kill me inside now I know the way to go show me thing I will never know do you want to run away tonight ? he break my own heart into he break my own heart into a million piece no you be never gonna let it go we play these game , so who be to blame ? we never change , just stay the same do you really want somebody else ? say my name so I fall to the flame feel you flow in my vein we both know now love be not real ____________ name Desire Artist Perturbator , Greta Link album I be the night write by Greta Link
