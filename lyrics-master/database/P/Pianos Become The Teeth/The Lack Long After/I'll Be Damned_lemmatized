maybe ... ; maybe you see your mother , maybe she be smile , she hear your catch laughter , she have miss your charm , we never make it to Cooperstown but I have still get that glove under my bed , maybe I will see you , we could shoot the shit , finally have a beer , " have a catch , " but for now its catch my tear , its catch my breath , I can just hear you say " come on bud , get out of that funk , it be time to move on , " it be funny how you still apply , you still know me , I will try to take your tool and make something worth while , try to make ya proud , I have learn nothing be spotless anymore , but I will let you resonate ... ; maybe your heaven be that Norman Rockwell scene where you and your friend be sing that Gordon Lightfoot song , " if you could only read my mind , " well if you could only read my mind , well that end , it be just too hard to take , be it good than Clapton ? do you see your father eye ? I know it be wishful thinking hope this wo n't always kill me , but if you see yours , then I will see mine , you finally stretch your foot and ghost away from me , you have to fade away , you have to leave I be plead for one more time with what I know now , I be beg for the same flake to fall twice for the first time , I be beg for what be n't say . that night the snow shape the land , and I walk home , I laugh the whole way because I suppose if it hurt , it be worth it , but now that ghost be me . ____________________ name I will be damn Artist piano become the tooth album the lack long after
