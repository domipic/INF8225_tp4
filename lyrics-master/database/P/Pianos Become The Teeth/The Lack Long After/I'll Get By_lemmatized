I use to listen to my life , I be so put together , I choose what I want to be in that age of chase sand , the age of believe in everything , but I could n't save you , I could n't save what be take away , and I be still sing , and you still ca n't stay . you " love life , " and those word have last , I just wish I would have have ear for more than what you say because I still feel the lack long after . such a light body , such a quiet gait leave behind the weight of the world , I will always think it be too early to lose your shine , I guess the means that end us mean nothing , I just hope it be the peace we all need , because I could love and drown in your God damned smile line , but I think I burn up watch you rally to stay alive , and I guess that be fine . it seem we all get sick , we all die in some no name hospital with the same colored wall , and I guess that be fine , but I want to swallow , I want to stomach , I want to live . it have be a rough while and some day be bad than other , there be no proper way to feel , no mirth , no levity , no amazing grace , just a flame on a lake float away , I ca n't let you lay , I want you to know , I be learn patience against my will , I want you to know , I will get by , always barely scrape with just a hunger , with just a heart apart , it be a hell of a thing . _________________ name I will get by artist piano become the tooth album the lack long after
