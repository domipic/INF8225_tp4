you be lay here with a bed eye view of a body that no longer belong to you , you be scare that the past @card@ have n't live past their @card@ be and if you break the trend , you will just end up like the old folk at Roland and @card@ , you be scare because you be an army brat of a man who die before his time . I miss those summer , that grill smell , home cook meal , take me back , sleep like a log , heal so fast , but lose you , I learn to lose my youth , lose my spirit , and now I ca n't hear it anymore , and I guess that be life back then our body part stay in place , we keep up with our own heart , it be so easy to temper the sting , just be fix by a quick dip back in some old neighbor 's swimming pool now I be just wear out , and I will ache like this forever I think , these shoddy drape refuse to keep the cold out and this damn body ca n't keep the warmth in , I be watch my hairline recede , I be drink fatigue , I be fight heredity I see less of who I love the most , time be get away , and we be so slow to say how fast it go , I be just look for what be come , what be build in the blood but I have never be that sure of anything anyway and I do n't want to heal , I be just about the perfect amount to look how I feel and I think about you lay there , wait for her to get back , I think about your last @card@ breath and I wonder if you know , I think about let you go and I guess that be life . ________________ name Good Times Artist piano become the tooth album the lack long after
