it be the rise of the vulture ; I feel the panic all those who be nervous with loss of dynamic your blood have be poison , if your heart be sour hear the sound of the war drum we be take the power we be take the power we be take the power we be take the power it be the rise of the vulture ; gonna keep on climb no chance of escape ; no use in hide through the eye of the storm , with a silver lining to the point where it break , gonna keep on grind we be take the power we be take the power we be take the power overboard , under pressure overboard , under pressure overboard , under pressure overboard , under pressure we be take the power we be take the power we be take the power we be take the power we be take the power we be take the power we be take the power we be take the power _________________ name the vulture artist pendulum album immersion
