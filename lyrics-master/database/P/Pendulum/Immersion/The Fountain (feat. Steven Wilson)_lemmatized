you sure you be right ? well no ; you be wrong you do n't feel my energy , but it wo n't be long I see the sun ; believe the dark soon I disappear , but I will make my mark all these fear , and all this love all you have give me , but it be not enough all my dream , and all this stuff all make real , but it be not enough watching , wait , shape , fake shocking , pump , mock , stop Falling , stall , warning , crawl reject , perfect , maraud , end behind my eye be rage alone but you do n't understand ; it be all homegrown I be not afraid ; I just do n't belong it may be cynical , but it all seem wrong all these fear , and all this love all you have give me , but it be not enough all my dream , and all this stuff all make real , but it be not enough watching , wait , shape , fake shocking , pump , mock , stop Falling , stall , warning , crawl reject , perfect , maraud , end behind my eye be rage alone but you do n't understand ; it be all homegrown I be not afraid ; I just do n't belong it may be cynical , but it all seem wrong all these fear , and all this love all you have give me , but it be not enough all my dream , and all this stuff all make real , but it be not enough watching , wait , shape , fake shocking , pump , mock , stop Falling , stall , warning , crawl reject , perfect , maraud , end ________________________________________ name the Fountain ( feat .
