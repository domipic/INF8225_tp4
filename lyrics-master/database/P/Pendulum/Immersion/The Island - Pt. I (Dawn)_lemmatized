you arrive in the rise sun the hidden passenger that I have be take close your eye ; let be forget it again as you drag me down , I will take you in what be you wait for ? just surrender here tonight what be you wait for ? as we go towards the light when everything be say and do still look for answer , if only one turn my back ; the urge have go leave with no reason , we come undo I be catch in your slow release seem like your traveler be eager to move me my reflection will slowly fade to another time , until my head escape what be you wait for ? just surrender here tonight what be you wait for ? as we go towards the light when everything be say and do still look for answer , if only one turn my back ; the urge have go leave with no reason , we come undone _______________________________ name the Island - Pt .
