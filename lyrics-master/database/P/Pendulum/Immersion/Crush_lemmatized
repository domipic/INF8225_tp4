I be run out in the cold light , wonder where to go to run away without you all my fear be come home , and it be rip out for the show you ca n't be me ; I will become you tonight I be wander under black sky , clutch at what be mine no control leave to lose when I feel that it would n't phase me , I run and hide like a child I feel so guilty ; I will make it up to you tonight creature I have be dream be come down they be change my future vision I have bury underground return as our future I be break out of my old skin , choke upon release I be in no state to judge you scratch itch good left alone ; chase memory I use to own I ca n't wait until this be over tonight creature I have be dream be come down they be change my future vision I have bury underground return as our future well , the nightmare I have be have have arrive they be change my future sign of my creation at my door how could you do this to her ? ___________ name crush artist pendulum album immersion
