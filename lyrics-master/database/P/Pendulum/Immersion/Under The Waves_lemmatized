I lie still as the water , but my vision be break Head catch in the tide as cruel as the ocean dream be make in the distance ; I will not be among them silence be kill me , and I can hardly touch the ground , touch the ground , touch the ground ... I be deep in a river , wave above my head Held with no spirit , we descend we reach the end I be deep in a river , wave above my head Held with no spirit , we descend we reach the end I be deep in a river , wave above my head Held with no spirit , we descend we reach the end we descend we reach the end _____________________ name under the wave artist pendulum album immersion
