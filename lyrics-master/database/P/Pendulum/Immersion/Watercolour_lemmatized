when I be fall down , will you pick me up again ? when I be too far go ; dead in the eye of my friend will you take me out of here , when I be stare down the barrel ? when I be blind by the light ? when I can see your face ? take me out of here take me out of here take me out of here take me out of here all I believe , and all I have know be be take from me ; I ca n't get home yeah , do your bad , when world collide let their fear collapse bring no surprise take me out of here feed the fire ; break your vision throw your fist up ; come on with me feed the fire ; break your vision throw your fist up ; come on with me feed the fire ; break your vision throw your fist up ; come on with me feed the fire ; break your vision throw your fist up ; come on with me just stay where you be ; let your fear subside just stay where you be , if there be nothing to hide feed the fire ; break your vision throw your fist up ; come on with me feed the fire ; break your vision throw your fist up ; come on with me feed the fire ; break your vision throw your fist up ; come on with me feed the fire ; break your vision throw your fist up ; come on with me feed the fire ; break your vision throw your fist up ; come on with me feed the fire ; break your vision throw your fist up ; come on with me _________________ name Watercolour Artist pendulum album immersion
