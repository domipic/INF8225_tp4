manipulation do n't shape me ; I be just fill the bottle out and even though this curse restrain me , I ca n't see anything to yell about well , I could fight this , but I may die and all I want be to be the apple in your eye well , I could stay here , strap on my face listen to the one who put me in my place I be a serial fantasy destroyer and you wanna know what I be go to do about it you think that my hand be behind my back think I do n't have the nerve to throw it away ' Cause I get the patience to see that you drown to watch you go down throw it away ' Cause I get the patience to see that you drown to watch you go down I be a reality you wish you be at at war against your constant manipulation all this time you think that I believe you the more you say , the easy to throw it away ' Cause I get the patience to see that you drown to watch you go down throw it away ' Cause I get the patience to see that you drown to watch you go down __________________ name Comprachicos Artist pendulum album immersion
