you could n't even show yourself out you be so hold up by your thought along the way we get divide and I be left show you the door you could n't look me in the eye , so I will dim the light when you take me out on your side we be spin out of sight believe me , I be on your side it take so long for me to speak up it be the hard thing to say take right up to the entrance at the last minute , turn away just ca n't look you in the eye , so let be dim the light get a case out ; pack up your pride it be over ; we be out of time do n't leave me ; I be on your side for everything that could have be well , at least we take the ride there be no relief in bitterness might as well have let it die _____________ name encoder artist pendulum album immersion
