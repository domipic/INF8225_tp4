see you the other day , look so undermine acting like it would n't happen ; make sense of anything that you could find because it be just about to happen , and you will be there you must have know the storm be come when the cloud appear May as well let the rain come down and join the circus of people while you be there something be change , bruise and ache and I be try to find out what it be when I fix her , she be break ; reason keep escape me protect and burn like a cyst I know that I can help you ; I just do n't fuck want to and the feeling get strong by the day say that I be selfish , but I do n't really need this and I be just so sick of the chase while you be let your guard down , I will be let myself go while you keep run your ship aground , I will be set myself alight too late ; you drop the drawbridge you let the vampire in you cause this shit to happen , and now you want out too late ; you drop the drawbridge you let the vampire in I hope you know now that it be nobody 's fault but yours while you be let your guard down , I will be let myself go while you keep run your ship aground , I will be set myself alight _________________ name the Tempest Artist pendulum album in Silico
