it seem like you be wait for nothing look like time have dilute it all and maybe everything that could have be be throw away so just take what be leave , and somehow fill the space when I can see through it all , I feel safe again I feel warm sound of life outside why do I die ? sound of life outside one by one Ai n't get nothing to hide one by one could n't have see it come from an inch away but it be here , right on time wait for the flash of grey , and we will feel the same if we can just drift for a while when I be back on the ground , I feel safe again I feel warm sound of life outside why do I die ? sound of life outside one by one Ai n't get nothing to hide sound of life outside why do I die ? sound of life outside one by one Ai n't get nothing to hide one by one ______________________________________ name sound of Life ( ft.
