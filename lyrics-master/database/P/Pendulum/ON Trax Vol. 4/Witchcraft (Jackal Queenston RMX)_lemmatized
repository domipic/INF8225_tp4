it be in your eye ; a colour fade out look like a new transition it be start up and shake your ground turn your head to see a new day calling do it feel like a head to lean on ? a snapshot from where you be bear I be look for your hand in the rough you be catch in the wire ; well , I will lift you out lead on the action , catch in a cellphone 's ray bleed on a sofa , stare at the wayside he be come and she know it , even though she know why footstep in the hallway ; girl , you have n't get time you gotta get out go far away you gotta get out go far away darkness in the bedroom ; maybe she be rest up maybe she be out late , just come back from the club I ca n't hear her breathing ; something do n't seem right Killer in the hallway ; we be live on a set time we gotta get out go far away we gotta get out go far away _______________________________________ name witchcraft ( jackal Queenston RMX ) Artist pendulum album on Trax Volume @card@
