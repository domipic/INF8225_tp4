unable , so lose I ca n't find my way Been search , but I have never see a turning , a turning from deceit ' Cause the child rose like try to reveal what I could feel I ca n't understand myself anymore ' Cause I be still feel lonely feel so unholy ' Cause the child rose like try to reveal what I could feel but this loneliness it just wo n't leave me alone , oh no I be fool somebody a faithless path I roam deceive to breath this secretly a silence , this silence I ca n't bear ' Cause the child rose like try to reveal what I could feel and this loneliness it just wo n't leave me alone , oh no and this loneliness , just wo n't leave me alone a lady of war a lady of war __________ name numb Artist Portishead album dummy
