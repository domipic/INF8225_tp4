we suffer everyday , what be it for ? these crown of illusion be fool us all and now I be weary , and I feel like I do it be only you , who can tell me apart and it be only you , who can turn my wooden heart the size of our fight , it be just a dream we have crush everything , I can see , in this morning selfishly how we have fail , and I feel like I do it be only you , who can tell me apart and it be only you , who can turn my wooden heart now that we have choose to take all we can this shade of autumn , a stale bitter end year of frustration lie down side by side and it be only you , who can tell me apart and it be only you , who can turn my wooden heart it be only you , who can tell me apart and it be only you , who can turn my wooden heart ______________ name only You Artist Portishead album Portishead
