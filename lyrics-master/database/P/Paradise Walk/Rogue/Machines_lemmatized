the darkness take a hold , another city will fall . another city will fall ( city will fall ... ) it will take what be leave of us before it tear down the wall . before it tear down the wall ( tear down the wall ... ) we stand toe-to-toe without a second thought , we be ready to fight , for that be all that we have get . with all the blood that have be shed , amongst the sand of time , how do we make it right ? how do we make it right ? ( do n't trust anymore ) Anoter city will fall . I will face the horror so that you can turn away , turn away . so if I carry or be carry upon my shield , I be still between the devil and the deep blue sea . I be not alone , I stand here with my brother , with a will of steel . but our hand , they still tremble because , a man 's home be not here , through the smoke and mirror , we be man not machine , but we be just another piece . I be cold , and I fear tonight , ( and I fear ... ) we wo n't get a second chance . I be cold , and I fear we wo n't get second chance . ______________ name Machines Artist Paradise Walk album Rogue track no @card@
