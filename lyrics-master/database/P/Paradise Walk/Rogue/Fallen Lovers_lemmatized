go be the day we use to run into the night , oh what I will give to do it one last time . against the odd with you by my side , [ turn your back , turn your back on all of us , turn your back on me ] I feel so alive , ( feel so alive , feel so alive ) . [ turn your back , turn your back on all of us , turn your back on me ] do we leave it behind , do we just walk away ? draw line in the sand that we have cross anyway . be you look for something more ? ( one careless kiss ) two fall lover , behind these eye it all lead to you . now you have turn your back on all of us , everything we have have turn to dust . these fractured mind and countless lie , [ turn your back , turn your back on all of us , turn your back on me ] will be the end of us , ( will be the end of us , will be the end of us ) . [ turn your back , turn your back on all of us , turn your back on me ] do we leave it behind , do we just walk away ? draw line in the sand that we have cross anyway . be you look for something more ? ( one careless kiss ) two fall lover , behind these eye it all lead to you . now that you have go , I be go to take what be leave . and now that you have go , I be go to walk to the edge . one careless kiss , two fallen lover . one careless kiss , two fallen lover . one careless kiss , two fallen lover . one careless kiss , two fallen lover . do we leave it behind , do we just walk away ? draw line in the sand that we have cross anyway . be you look for something more ? ( one careless kiss ) two fall lover , behind these eye it all lead to you . ___________________ name Fallen lover Artist Paradise Walk album Rogue track no @card@
