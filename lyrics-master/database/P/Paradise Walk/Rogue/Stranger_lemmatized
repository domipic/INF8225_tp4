under the cover of love , in the dark shadow of our heart , there be a fire that burn like a star , and now my heart be a stranger , and now my heart be a stranger . I can see that look in your eye , there be a fear that this could be real , I still taste the serpent 's kiss , when you be close , you be close to me . and your ghost , be call you out and your ghost , they be call you out . under the cover of love , in the dark shadow of our heart , there be a fire that burn like a star , and now my heart be a stranger , and now my heart be a stranger . can you stand to look in a mirror ? can you face what be there stare back ? or be there a fear that this be all real ? will you step up and face your past ? I think it be time we admit who we be . I think it be time we admit who we be . I think it be time we admit who we be . I think it be time we admit who we be . under the cover of love , in the dark shadow of our heart , there be a fire that burn like a star , and now my heart be a stranger , and now my heart be a stranger . under the cover of love , in the dark shadow of our heart , there be a fire that burn like a star , and now my heart be a stranger , and now my heart be a stranger . _____________________ name Stranger album Rogue Artist Paradise walk track no @card@
