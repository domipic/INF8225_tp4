be n't it a tranquil place I leave ? I be trustful . for nothing I can grip with my hand , but for a new chance . be n't it the false friend I believe in , I spend my time for ? I always wait for affection , for some friendly word . will I have the courage to stand with empty hand ? will I have the courage to do what life demand ? will I have the courage to stand with empty hand ? will I have the courage to do what life demand ? how many disappointment can I stand before I resignate ? when thing that once be charm get an ugly face . can I keep my favourite thing alive , the place I like the most ? I wo n't be careless with myself , I will protect my dream . will I have the courage to stand with empty hand ? will I have the courage to do what life demand ? will I have the courage to stand with empty hand ? will I have the courage to do what life demand ? will I have the courage to stand with empty hand ? will I have the courage to do what life demand ? will I have the courage to stand with empty hand ? will I have the courage to do what life demand ? __________________ name leave Home Artist underwater Pilots album tranquil place
