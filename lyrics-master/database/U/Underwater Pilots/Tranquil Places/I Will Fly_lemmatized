sometimes when I feel down it seem so like I be insane and it look like a never-end hole then I ca n't feel anything , no everything be meaningless day after day my time slip away when I drop me when I have lose myself no one see me but I need that and the sticky hole suck me in I feel lifeless something drive me I be control by thread connect to my hand and foot and I will fly away from my fear and I will fly to find myself but I be routined so I stand up and I change place Search new way but my thought go round in circle when I go out get in contact when I feel you when you see me piece by piece my life return and I will fly away from my fear and I will fly away from my fear and I will fly to find myself and I will fly away from my fear and I will fly to find myself and I will fly away from my fear and I will fly to find myself and I will fly away from my fear and I will fly to find myself and I will fly away from my fear ________________ name I Will Fly Artist underwater Pilots album tranquil place
