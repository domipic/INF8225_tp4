we be bear into a world , where intelligence be slave to money we have accept our thoughtlessness not to see our imperfection we want more and more and more we populate the earth like cancer we see all that , grin and bear it but ca n't stop kill welcome to the world our ego shine like silver and when we be go the earth will take a breath welcome to the world our ego shine like silver and when we be go the earth will take a breath Dusty ruin - witness of our past our eye look back through a veil of ash how will our future look ? radioactive landscape ? mutate being crawl on our way ? where be we go ? where be the escape ? welcome to the world our ego shine like silver and when we be go the earth will take a breath welcome to the world our ego shine like silver and when we be go the earth will take a breath welcome to the world our ego shine like silver and when we be go the earth will take a breath welcome to the world our ego shine like silver and when we be go the earth will take a breath welcome to the world our ego shine like silver and when we be go the earth will take a breath welcome to the world our ego shine like silver and when we be go the earth will take a breath __________________________ name welcome to the World Artist underwater Pilots album tranquil place
