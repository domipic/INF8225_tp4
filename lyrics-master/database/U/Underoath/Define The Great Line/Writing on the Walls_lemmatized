maybe we , why do n't we sit right here for half an hour ? we will speak of what a waste I be and how we miss your beat again I swear we need to find some comfort in this run-down place to bridge the gap of this Concious state that we live in and I be short on time how come you try to place us all to fit the shape of and I break what they tell you you to move on but mostly what they show you ( move on ) at this rate , we ca n't give up I be takin ' back all the thing I have say I be takin ' back all the thing I have say but I sure ca n't just sit still keep me fill in and I swear I will come we walk alone , we walk alone we walk alone , we walk alone we walk alone , we walk alone back home alone back home you be almost go and I be okay I still see your shadow to give you time to be afraid but never your face again I remember your presence I hope to God you come down I hope to God you feel this now I hope to God you come down I hope to God I know there must be some way out of here and all of them will be wait there __________________________ name write on the Walls Artist Underoath album define the Great Line
