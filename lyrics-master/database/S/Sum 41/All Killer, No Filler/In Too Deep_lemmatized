the faster we be fall we be stop and stall we be run in circle again just as thing be look up you say it be n't good enough but still we be try one more time maybe we be just try too hard when really it be close than it be too far ' Cause I be in too deep and I be try to keep up above in my head instead of go under ' Cause I be in too deep and I be try to keep up above in my head instead of go under instead of go under seem like each time I be with you , I lose my mind because I be bend over backwards to relate it 's one thing to complain but when you be drive me insane well , then I think it be time that we take a break maybe we be just try too hard when really it be close than it be too far ' Cause I be in too deep and I be try to keep up above in my head instead of go under ' Cause I be in too deep and I be try to keep up above in my head instead of go under instead of go under instead of go under I ca n't sit back and wonder why it take so long for this to die and I hate it when you fake it you ca n't hide it , you might as well embrace it so believe me , it be not easy it seem that something be tell me I be in too deep and I be try to keep up above in my head instead of go under ' Cause I be in too deep and I be try to keep up above in my head instead of go under instead of go under instead of go under again instead of go under instead of go under again instead of go under again _________________ name in Too Deep Artist Sum @card@ album all Killer , no Filler
