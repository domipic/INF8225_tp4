I be no angel I be not forsake , but I can bleed Tear me open , I believe God will set you up to bleed and no one can deceive what it be mean to be and " bloody murder " we will scream well I guess it be time for me tell me what I be leave to believe in ? cause I do n't know the concept of the pain I do n't want the faith I will just lose it I can prove it watch me bleed Tear me open , I believe God will set you up to bleed and no one can deceive what it be mean to be and " bloody murder " we will scream God will send you all to tear me open ! ' cause I be not give up no self control suffocate to the bone I be my bad enemy who ca n't be save I be just his disgrace Tear me open , I believe God will set you up to bleed and no one can deceive what it be mean to be and " bloody murder " we will scream God will send you all to tear me open ! these day be strange it be true . there be not a thing that I would change , no mistake that I will undo . _____________________________ name scream bloody murder artist Sum @card@ album scream bloody murder
