I try to be perfect , but nothing be worth it , I do n't believe it make me real . I think it will be easy , but no one believe me , I mean all the thing I say . if you believe it be in my soul , I will say all the word that I know , just to see if it would show , that I be try to let you know , that I be good off on my own . this place be so empty , my thought be so tempting , I do n't know how it get so bad . sometimes it be so crazy , that nothing could save me , but it be the only thing that I have . if you believe it be in my soul , I will say all the word that I know , just to see if it would show , that I be try to let you know , that I be good off on my own . ( on my own ! ) I try to be perfect , it just be n't worth it , nothing could ever be so wrong . it be hard to believe me , it never get easy , I guess I know that all along . if you believe it be in my soul , I will say all the word that I know , just to see if it would show , that I be try to let you know , that I be good off on my own . ____________ name Pieces Artist Sum @card@ album Chuck
