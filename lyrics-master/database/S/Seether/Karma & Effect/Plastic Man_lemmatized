I be a plastic man Wish I could be the one you could be proud of I be lose heart again Wish I could show you what you think I be make of someday I know I will find my place someday I know this pain will fade I be a perfect sale just wrap me up with your bow and flower I will neglect to tell I will sell your story that we love each other someday I know I will find my place someday I know this pain will fade someday I know I will find my place someday I will sing my last refrain why do n't you let me be and I will pretend I be well ' Cause you be too blind to see and I be too tired to tell and in your apathy your head begin to swell another tragedy that you be too cold to feel someday I know I will find my place someday I know this pain will fade someday I know I will find my place someday I will sing my last refrain _________________ name Plastic Man Artist Seether album Karma & effect
