I be just try for what be the point in it all where you fight your battle be you on my side ? I be do cry for moment I once adore why be all this in piece can n't you let it lie ? leave love alone Water under my skin we be a long way from home Water under in every step and all your work you have make I know you will take it back all along say the word I do n't want to feel in every step and all your work you have make leave it I ca n't bear sleep alone leave love alone Water under my skin look for a long time for me I guess it be all a memory I lose a bet , a bet here all I fear be die alone alone ___________________ name under my skin Artist SPC ECO album under my skin Year @card@
