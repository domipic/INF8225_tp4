from the soul of the unnamed to the devastating depth of the head and the heart of the shame , with patience like the fury of a freight train , I will always have faith in the untamed . I have faith in the untamed . no room to think when digression be fight . progression of thought die and go right out the door . it be hard to move on when tradition be the whore that keep your foot nail to the frozen floor . now it weigh down your mind and once again leave you deaf , dumb , and blind , but I have faith that one day we will have the strength to rip our every single page . I have faith . you will find no peace from this . you will still be empty . it will never end . this tradition be downfall . it be hard to let go when you be still hold on . you will find no peace from this . you will still be empty . you well believe we be break boundary . a routine for the uninspired , for the heart that lack any fire . you put your thought in die hand while you wade through the quicksand . __________________________ name Faith in the untamed Artist Stick to your gun album the Hope Division
