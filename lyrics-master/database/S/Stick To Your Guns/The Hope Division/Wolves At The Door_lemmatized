our hero leave to die . we push our young one to the side . and hung bright mind out to dry . in the downpour , we will drown if we dont find some truth . this be our nation without a roof . the fire of this hopelessness ignite . the fury of misfortune strike . Supreme isolation reign - the wolf be at the door we walk on common ground . its in our heart to help those that have be shut out . and if just one , we be all the tired and the poor . so lift your lamp before we break down the door . new colossus , they fall on blind eye and your teem shore , they multiply . naked as the birth of a New day amazing grace please show your sick and hungry a new fate . the wolf be at the door we walk on a common ground . its in our heart to help those that have be shut out . and if just one , we be all the tired and the poor . so lift your lamp before we break down the door . it be the obligation of those who have everything to help those who have nothing ________________________ name wolf at the Door Artist Stick to your gun album the Hope Division
