I live in the valley by the sea line with the scent of orange tree . this be the place that be always love me . I wake where the sun never sleep , in-between the mountain and where the water and sky meet . this be the place I be raise , my family and my friend . this be my everything . this be the place I be save , my beginning and end , I would n't trade it for anything . and just because I leave you do n't mean you leave my mind . I think about you all the time . this be my solid ground , this sun be n't go down , down , never go down . and I have see a lot of amazing thing , but there be no feeling like come home bring . now nothing can bring me down , down , down , never bring me down . just look at the view , if this be wrong then I do n't wanna be true . if you be not here then I do n't wanna be you . even if I try I could n't forget , it only make sense that my heart belong where the sun set . and when I start to smell the salt from the sea , I know I be close , I be come home . and just because I leave you do n't mean you leave my mind . I think about you all the time . this be my solid ground , this sun be n't go down , down , never go down . and I have see a lot of amazing thing , but there be no feeling like come home bring . now nothing can bring me down , down , down , never bring me down . Orange County , this one be for you ! and just because I leave you do n't mean you leave my mind . I think about you all the time . this be my solid ground , this sun be n't go down , down , never go down . and I have see a lot of amazing thing , but there be no feeling like come home bring . now nothing can bring me down , down , down , never bring me down . I think about you all the time . down , down , never bring me down . down , down , never bring me down . ________________________________ name where the Sun never sleep Artist Stick to your gun album the Hope Division
