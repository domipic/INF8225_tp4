she think , " another day I be leave to drag my break soul through the street , into work and school , then back home " not a man in her life that make her feel whole because it be the man in her life that fill her with those hole . " what have I do to deserve this ? " to face a raise fist that scream , " you think I like this bitch ? ! " do n't you worry my darling , mommy just trip she can feel her sanity start to slip so she dream , if I could just go ... beyond the sun where I ca n't feel pain where I could just fade away beyond the sun , where no one life but me help me entangle in a web of complete misery her cry be stifle by a fear of what he might do to the kid " if i just stick it out this might end soon " " this be all my fault , if I have just do what he say I could have avoid this all " and still she dream , if I could just go ... beyond the sun where I ca n't feel pain where I could just fade away beyond the sun , where no one life but me help me how can we let this be ? our sister and mother be die how can we let this be ? our mother be die how can we let this be ? ____________________ name beyond the Sun Artist Stick to your gun album Diamond
