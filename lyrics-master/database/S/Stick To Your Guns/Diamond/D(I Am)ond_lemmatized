I be a brave man , I be a coward I be the tiger , I be the flower I be honest , and I be a liar I be vital , I be tired I be a free man , I be catch from where I be , I see the top I be , most importantly never concern with what I be not . ( I be ) a brave man , a coward the tiger , the flower ( I be ) honest , a liar I be vital and so fuck tired ( I be ) a free man , I be catch from where I be , I see the top ( I be ) most importantly never concern with what I be not . ( I be ) forever more than just survive this be my life and this life be my diamond . ________________ name D ( I Am ) ond Artist Stick to your gun album Diamond
