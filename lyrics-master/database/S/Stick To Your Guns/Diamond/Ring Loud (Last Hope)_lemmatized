my friend , what have you so troubled ? why have you turn life into such a struggle ? I see it in you no matter how hard it try to hide ; the war in your heart and fire in your eye . I ca n't follow , trust me I have try . my path be light by a bright light . I will always sing humanity 's song , we may fall but we will carry on . may these word ring loud . ___________________________ name Ring Loud ( Last Hope ) Artist Stick to your gun album Diamond
