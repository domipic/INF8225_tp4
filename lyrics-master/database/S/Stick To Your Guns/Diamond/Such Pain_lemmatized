I do n't think I could ever let you go but if you stay I know that I will lose control . all the thing that we have be through I ca n't believe all I have do just to protect you . suffocate by the thin line I walk between who I be and who I think I should be . point every finger I could still nothing be right to me . I be the enemy . such Pain . climb like ivy from my foot to my face . my only enemy be me . _______________ name such Pain Artist Stick to your gun album Diamond
