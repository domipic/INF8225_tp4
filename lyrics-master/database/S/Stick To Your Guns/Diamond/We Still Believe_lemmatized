we still believe I be sick and tired of all this give up , all I hear be talk , and I have have enough . single mind , overwhelmingly one side . refuse humanity , do not award morality . hope be not dead so we will forever scream , until it be deafen . we still believe we be the one , who stay awake , while the world sleep . because we still believe . we be the one , who will achieve , what the world dream . because we still believe . you open the gate , and what come rush out be far too powerful for you to hold down . if there be a good way , someone please tell me now , but there be not , this be what we still believe we be the one , who stay awake , while the world sleep . because we still believe . we be the one , who will achieve , what the world dream . because we still believe . from here on out , I will live deliberately ! I ca n't sit back , to watch the world die , I must fight back ! I will pay the price , there be more to this , not just me ! we still believe we be the one , who stay awake , while the world sleep . because we still believe . we be the one , who will achieve , what the world dream . because we still believe . ______________________ name we still believe Artist Stick to your gun album Diamond
