the rage that build in us be bring you down . chew up and spit out , lose and alone . your job be rip from you and on deck , your home . can n't feed yourself , let alone feed the kid . American dream have turn to your American greed . their finger be cross while they smile and promise . the wrong side of broke while our gold line their pocket . on the priority list we place dead last , and their foreclosed sign line our " green grass . " look me in my eye you crook fuck . not one more god damn lie . your time be up . the rage that build in us be bring you down . watch the weight of it all come crash down . United , now the king will lose their crown . now we be shit out of luck and they do n't give a fuck . no they do n't give a fuck . now the mass awaken . the embodiment of sacrifice . history in the making . witness define moment of our life . their finger be cross while they smile and promise . the wrong side of broke while our gold line their pocket . on the priority list we place dead last , and their foreclosed sign line our " green grass . " look me in my eye you crook fuck . not one more god damn lie . your time be up . the rage that build in us be bring you down . watch the weight of it all come crash down . United , now the king will lose their crown . the rage that build in us be bring you down . _______________________ name bring you down Artist Stick to your gun album Diamond
