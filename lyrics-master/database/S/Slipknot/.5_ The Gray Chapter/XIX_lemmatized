this song be not for the living this song be for the dead with my face against the floor I ca n't see who knock me out of the way I do n't want to get back up but I have to , so it might as well be today nothing appeal to me , no one feel like me I be too busy being calm to disappear I be in no shape to be alone contrary to the shit that you might hear so walk with me , walk with me do n't let the symbolism kill your heart walk with me , walk with me just like we should have do right from the start walk with me , walk with me do n't let this fuck world tear you apart _________ name XIX Artist slipknot album @card@ : the Gray Chapter
