it have be year since anyone could be a friend it be the fear that kill the feeling , in the end can we face it ? can we shape it ? can we really die ? if rain be what you want , all you have to do be close your eye just close your eye I be watch resurrection start to crawl be there any chance in hell ? any chance at all ? do we need it ? do we see it ? be it really there ? if rain be what you want , then take your seat , enjoy the fall enjoy the fall the only thing deep than my last breath the only thing dark than my last death be the panic , the static I have come back from the dead but my city will never sleep again in these diamond we be leave with coloured glass as pressure take its toll , we will outlast but you ca n't break my heart as long as I can be myself , I will never fall apart and you ca n't take me in if I be not break , break me down so I will never feel alone again the only thing deep than my last breath the only thing dark than my last death be the panic , the static I have come back from the dead but my city ( will never sleep again ) my city will never sleep again my city will never sleep again my city will never sleep again my city will never sleep again ______________________________ name if Rain be what you Want Artist slipknot album @card@ : the Gray Chapter
