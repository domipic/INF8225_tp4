my guilt and my shame always sell me short , always feel the same and my face and my soul always wear me thin , always under control but the long hour you will have in your life be the one you sit through to know if you be right so I will wait , but I will pray that I be wrong because I think I know what be go on ! so let me get this straight : the only will be my own ? I do whatever I want and stay alone ? all my decision make it untouchable and tainted I be gonna suffer for the rest of my life but I will always find a way to survive I be not a failure , but I know what it be like I can take it or leave it , or die ! stay , you do n't always know where you stand , till you know that you wo n't run away there be something inside me that feel like breathe in sulfur like breathe in sulfur ! my life be undo and I be a sinner to most but a sage to some and my god be untrue , I be probably wrong , but I be good than you and the long hour I have have in my life , be the one I go through to know I be right so I be safe , but I be a little outside I be gonna laugh when I be bury alive ! stay , you do n't always know where you stand , till you know that you wo n't run away there be something inside me that feel like breathe in sulfur like breathe in sulfur ! like breathing in sulfur ! stay , you do n't always know where you stand , till you know that you wo n't run away there be something inside me that feel like breathe in sulfur like breathe in sulfur ... stay , you do n't always know where you stand , ( you do n't always know where you stand ) till you know that you wo n't run away there be something inside me that feel ( there be something inside me that feel ) like breathe in sulfur ! like breathing in sulfur ... like breathe in sulfur ! like breathing in sulfur ! like breathing in sulfur ! like breathing in sulfur ... ____________ name sulfur artist slipknot album All Hope be go
