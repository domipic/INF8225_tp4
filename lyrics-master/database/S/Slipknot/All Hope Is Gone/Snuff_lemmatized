bury all your secret in my skin come away with innocence , and leave me with my sin the air around me still feel like a cage and love be just a camouflage , for what resemble rage again so if you love me let me go and run away before I know my heart be just too dark to care I ca n't destroy what be n't there deliver me unto my fate if I be alone I can hate I do n't deserve to have you Ooh my smile be take long ago , if I can change I hope I never know I still press your letter to my lip and cherish them in part of me , that savor every kiss I could n't face a life without your light ( without your light ) but all of that be rip apart , when you refuse to fight so save your breath I will not hear I think I make it very clear you could n't hate enough to love be that suppose to be enough I only wish you be n't my friend then I could hurt you in the end I never claim to be a saint Ooh my own be banish long ago , it take the death of hope to let you go oh oh so break yourself against my stone and spit your pity in my soul you never need any help you sell me out to save yourself and I wo n't listen to your shame you run away you be all the same Angels lie to keep control Ooh my love be punish long ago , if you still care do n't ever let me know if you still care do n't ever let me know ___________ name snuff artist slipknot album All Hope be go
