sit in the dark I ca n't forget even now , I realize the time I will never get another story of the bitter pill of fate I ca n't go back again , I ca n't go back again but you ask me to love you and I do trade my emotion for a contract to commit and when I get away I only get so far the other me be dead . I hear his voice inside my head we be never alive and we wo n't be bear again but I will never survive with dead memory in my heart Dead memory in my heart Dead memory in my heart you tell me to love you and I do tie my soul into a knot and get me to submit so when I get away , I only keep my scar the other me be go . now I do n't know where I belong we be never alive and we wo n't be bear again but I will never survive with dead memory in my heart Dead memory in my heart Dead memory in my heart Dead memory in my heart Dead vision in your name Dead finger in my vein Dead memory in my heart Dead memory in my heart Dead memory in my heart Dead memory in my heart oh , oh ___________________ name Dead Memories Artist slipknot album All Hope be go
