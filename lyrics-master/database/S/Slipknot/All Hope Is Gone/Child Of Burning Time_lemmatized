child of burn time child of burn time my only consolation be a lie the apex of my consequence be die here tonight Winter have n't end and it always look like rain I ca n't remember anything ( anything ) inside the absolution , we succumb and appetite be bittersweet ; I think I be go numb a chance to give up avarice have mark my one regret the child of burning time be go he have n't come back yet ... before I tell my story , please consider who I be I miss my window year ago ; I be do all I can a tragedy be commonplace , but in the end , they go away my skin be still the only stain I be leave to wear in shame I cut my name into my heart I will tear it all apart I beg you Burn me away I wo n't become your hero just to fight the life I save Burn me away I wo n't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today I burn away my isolation be my course the effect it have on life itself be a cancer on its source I rue the moment spend between the fetish and the flame until this war be over , I wo n't ever lose my rage I cut my name into my soul I guess I will never know I beg you Burn me away I wo n't become your hero just to fight the life I save Burn me away I wo n't give up tomorrow just to lose it all today Burn me away I wo n't become your hero just to fight the life I save Burn me away I wo n't give up tomorrow just to lose it all , lose it all today ___________________________ name child of burn Time Artist slipknot album All Hope be go
