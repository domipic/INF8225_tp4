why , be everything so gray , be everything so strange be everything so throw together by mistake ? why , be everything contrite , be everything a plight be everything so insincere and out of sight ? why , do everything seem wrong , do everything look draw , do everything seem blasted like it do n't belong ? I wanna make it a way , I wanna make it a waste I wanna make it a gross misadventure I wanna make you all ! I wanna make you all ! I wanna make you Lie to me , lie to me when , do everything go bad , do everything fall flat , do everything decay and lose itself so fast ? when , do everything succumb , do everything go numb , do everything lobotomize what it be become ? when , do everything come back , do everything relapse , do everything save face and find itself at last ? I wanna show you the way , I wanna show you the waste I wanna show you the bad misadventure I wanna show you all ! I wanna show you all ! I wanna show you how to die for me , die for me I wanna give it a way , I wanna give it the waste I wanna give it the bad misadventure I wanna give it all ! I be gonna give it all ! I will never give up ! lie to me , die for me now , everything be a lie , everything be your lie everything be a face inside another lie now , everything be a side , everything 's one side everything depend on just which side you be on ________________ name 1st Person Artist Stone Sour album come what ( ever ) May
