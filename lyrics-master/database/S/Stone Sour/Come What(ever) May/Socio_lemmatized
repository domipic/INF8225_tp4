I remember now , but I still have my doubt I think it be gonna be today everybody come , but it be just not the same why do it have to be today ? now my chest be tight no , I be not all right it do n't have to be this way why do it have to be this way ? I do n't know what be wrong , it be like I be too far go it do n't matter anyway fear be in my heart , just when I stop , it start and I can never live this way freedom in a cage , no sun and too much rage I do n't know how much I can take push it down inside , but it know just where I hide I know that " normal " be hard to fake bleeding into life , it be like a thousand knife be slowly turn me to this why do it have to be like this ? I do n't know what be wrong , it be like I be too far go it do n't matter anyway fear be in my heart , just when I stop , it start and I can never live this way I do n't know what be wrong , it be like I be too far go it do n't matter anyway fear be in my heart , just when I stop , it start and I can never live this way I lose again today I lose again , I lose again today I lose again , I lose again today I do n't know what be wrong , it be like I be too far go it do n't matter anyway fear be in my heart , just when I stop , it start and I can never live this way live with a curse , sometimes it be even bad it slowly kill me everyday something I despise be gonna take my life I guess I will try again today ___________ name Socio Artist Stone Sour album come what ( ever ) May
