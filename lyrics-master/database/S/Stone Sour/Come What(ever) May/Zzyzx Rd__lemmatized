I do n't know how else to put this . it have take me so long to do this . I be fall asleep and I ca n't see straight . my muscle feel like a melee , my body be curl in a U-shape . I put on my good , but I be still afraid . prop up by lie and promise . save my place as life forget . maybe it be time I see the world . I be only here for a while . and patience be not my style , and I be so tired that I get to go . what be I suppose to hide now ? what be I suppose to do ? do you really think I would n't see this through ? tell me I should stick around for you . tell me I can have it all . I be still too tired to care and I get to go . I get to go home in one week . but I be leave home in three week . they throw me a bone just to pick me dry . I be follow suit and direction . I crawl up inside for protection . I be tell what to do and I do n't know why . I be over exist in limbo . I be over the myth and placebo . I do n't really mind if I just fade away . I be ready to live with my family . I be ready to die in obscurity ' Cause I be so tired that I get to go . where be I suppose to hide now ? what be I suppose to do ? you still do n't think I be gonna see this through ? tell me I be a part of history . tell me I can have it all . I be still too tired to care and I get to go . I be still too tired to care and I get to go I be still too tired to care and I get to go I be still too tired to care and I get to go I be still too tired to care and I get to go I be still too tired to care and I get to go I be still too tired to care and I get to go _______________ name Zzyzx Rd .
