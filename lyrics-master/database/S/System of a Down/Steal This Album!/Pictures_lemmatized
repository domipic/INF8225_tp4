flaunt your will at every wheel , parachute your chocolate soul , cobblestone under your wheel , I get picture on my mind , I get picture on my mind , I get picture on my mind , I get picture on my mind . circumvent your thick ego , Wooden fart , they be on the go , you ca n't tell me that I be real , I get picture on my mind , I get picture on my mind , I get picture on my mind , I get picture on my mind . fear wait , for us , when the present ca n't be seal , away , gold dust , now the dish can be clear . fear wait , for us , till the moment be reveal , then turn to rust for the mighty conquer meal . can n't you look at my shave ass , ounce be go , and God be once , you ca n't see me suddenly , I get picture on my mind , I get picture on my mind , I get picture on my mind , I get picture on my mind . I get picture on my mind . ______________ name Pictures Artist System of a Down album steal this album !
