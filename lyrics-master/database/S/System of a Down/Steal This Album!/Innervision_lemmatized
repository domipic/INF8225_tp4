well I have a home , long to roam I have to find you , I have to meet you sign of your face , slow your pace I need your guidance , I need to seek my Innervision , innervision My pupil dance , lose in a trance your sacred silence , lose all violence Stars in their place , mirror your face I need to find you , I need to seek my Innervision , innervision , innervision it be never too late to reinvent the bicycle a smile bring forth energy or life give you force it be never too late to reinvent the bicycle a smile bring forth energy or life give you force Vision there be only one true path in life the road that lead to all lead to one ( Innervision ) there be only one true path in life ( Innervision ) the road that lead to all Innervision your sacred silence , lose all violence _________________ name Innervision Artist System of a Down album steal this album !
