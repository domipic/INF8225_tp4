I need , I feel , a love , you love to love the fear , I never want to be alone , I have forget to , the road keep move cloud , the cloud become unreal , I guess I will always be at home , do you want me to try , direct your night , an exit light the sky , the sky become complete , travel heart divide the throne , I have forget to , friction , line , bump , the highway song complete , the sign be all turn right , do you want me to try , direct your night , Want me to try , direct your light , the pure form of life , our day be never come back , the cannon of our time , our day be never come back , the pure form of life , our day be never come back , the cannon of our time , our day be never ever come back . our day be never come back , our day be never come back , our day be never come back . __________________ name Highway Song Artist System of a Down album steal this album !
