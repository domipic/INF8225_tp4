I know a place where the wounded go for cold soul unaware with no self control I know a place where the break and wound go you just sit back and listen and just do what you be tell never know how thing could have be as you grow old this be your time and it be wear thin do n't let this happen again and again you can catch me in a storm of thought and prayer sleep away your American nightmare I wo n't lie with you in your grave sleep away your American nightmare sleep , it . sleep it away , your American nightmare you just sit back and listen and just do what you be tell never know how thing could have be as you grow old this be your time and its wear thin do n't let this happen again and again I may be wound I do n't need to be save and though I be wounded I do n't need to be save I wo n't lie , I wo n't lie , with you in your grave so put your fist in the air to the sound of the new beat ________________ name death bed Artist Stray from the Path album rise Sun
