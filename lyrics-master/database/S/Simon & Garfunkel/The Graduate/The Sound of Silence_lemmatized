hello , darkness , my old friend I have come to talk with you again because a vision softly creep leave its seed while I be sleep and the vision that be plant in my brain still remain within the sound of silence in restless dream I walk alone Narrow street of cobblestone ' Neath the halo of a streetlamp I turn my collar to the cold and damp when my eye be stab by the flash of a neon light that split the night and touch the sound of silence and in the naked light I see ten thousand people , maybe more people talk without speak people hear without listen people write song that voice never share and no one dare disturb the sound of silence " fool , " say I , " you do not know silence like a cancer grow hear my word that I might teach you take my arm that I might reach you " but my word like silent raindrop fall listen to the sound listen to the sound and echo listen to the sound and echo in the well of silence and the people bow and pray to the neon god they make and the sign flash out its warning in the word that it be form and the sign say , " the word of the prophet be write on the subway wall and tenement hall and whisper in the sound of silence " __________________________ name the sound of silence Artist Simon & Garfunkel album the graduate
