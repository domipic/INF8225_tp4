have you lose all your sense ? why do you have to go tempting fate ? blind by your ambition why ca n't you see the chaos you create ? oh - have we go too far , too fast ? my die eye - scream with pain all my hope and my dream drown in flame and all the Lies - shine so bright all the soul of the world light up the night you be a slave to desire for lust of profit you consume my soul do you think you can make it stop ? oh no - it be too late to turn , you have lose control oh - have we go too far too fast ? my die eye - scream with pain all my hope and my dream drown in flame and all the Lies - shine so bright all the soul of the world light up the night push the boundary - reinvent a new reality change evolution - ignore the past as we realize our destructive destiny ... my die eye - scream with pain all my hope and my dream drown in flame and all the Lies - shine so bright all the soul of the world light up the night ________________________ name light up the night Artist Symphony X album iconoclast
