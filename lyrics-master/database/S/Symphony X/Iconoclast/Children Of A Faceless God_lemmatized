scream at the wall around me - broken and alone fighting with my inner demon be all I have ever know all I be - I give to you all my dream and nightmare , too disconnect life of anguish - the mirror fade to black feel like I be sink deep into illusion . no one be stare back somewhere unseen - there be something between be it the truth or a lie ... can n't you see - you and me we be child of a faceless God misery be our destiny we be child of a faceless God just another faceless shadow - I be desensitize and I do n't feel the pain , be I insane ? my nightmare be realize somewhere unseen - there be something between be it the truth or a lie ... can n't you see - you and me we be child of a faceless God misery be our destiny we be child of a faceless God All I have - I give to you all my dream , my nightmare , too wretched promenade - watch the freak parade celebrate the suffering and affliction laugh at tragedy - worship sin with me let us share in selfish addiction spit on the shrine - drink the poison wine leave a life in ruin - tatter and tear completely interfaced to a God without a Face in his image of darkness ... I be reborn can n't you see - you and me we be child of a faceless God misery be our destiny we be child of a faceless God ________________________________ name child of a faceless God Artist Symphony X album iconoclast
