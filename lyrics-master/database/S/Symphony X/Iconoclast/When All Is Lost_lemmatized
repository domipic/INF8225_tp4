I believe ... nothing ever come to light chase shadow in the night in a starless sky and I wonder why I believe ... we will never find a way that darkness light the day we never question why , still I wonder : why ? I close my eye lose in a memory just like a candle in the wind what could have be , with just one kiss goodbye you spread your wing to fly far away , somehow , someday you will understand I hope you will understand ... someday silent picture speak like ghost in the machine haunt my reflection in the frame chase down the hopeful child inside of me where will it all go wrong and who be to blame we pass the time away with empty life , the laughter die be this all we have to show ? be this all they will ever know ? can they find their way ? what go wrong ? where have all the hero go ? trading future for a song we give away think only of myself , I forge ahead no regret , no apology Bitter tear reward the life that I have lead a world of lie bring me to my knee I take the road with every twist and every turn the word of wisdom be the lesson never learn Lose your fear and free your soul or the mystery of life you will truly never know you will truly never know be this all we have to show ? be this all they will ever know ? can they find their way ? what go wrong ? where have all the hero go ? trading future for a song we give away just give away I close my eye , lose in that memory like a candle in the wind what could have be , with just one kiss goodbye you spread your wing to fly far away I hope you will understand one day we pass the time away with empty life , the laughter die and the color fade , fade away Oh daylight fade away oh no no no ! be this all we have to show ? be this all they will ever know ? can they find their way ? what go wrong ? where have all the hero go ? trading future for a song we give away what go wrong ? where have all our hero go ? trade our future for a song , we give it all away ... ______________________ name when all I lose Artist Symphony X album iconoclast
