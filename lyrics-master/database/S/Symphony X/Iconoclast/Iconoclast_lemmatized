rise of the one - the dark iconoclast forge a cult of fear , with legion unsurpassed shout the word - with vicious tongue of fire bear of illusion and deceit , fiendish soul of a liar . the chaos unseen rip the midnight sky infernal machine arise - flesh and steel collide we be strong we will stand and fight we be strong we will stand and fight with rage we ride into the flame strike with Spears of hate , at the heart where evil reign hold the line from the charge of armored steed Gather around this deadly ground , come watch the War God bleed . the chaos unseen rip the midnight sky infernal machine arise - flesh and steel collide we be strong we will stand and fight we be strong we will stand and fight Victory or death , only time will tell synthetic resurrection , from the heart of hell slowly they fall , as we watch the daylight die we spit and curse this hallowed earth with our final battle cry . the chaos unseen rip the midnight sky infernal machine arise - flesh and steel collide we be strong we will stand and fight we be strong we will stand and fight ________________ name iconoclast Artist Symphony X album iconoclast
