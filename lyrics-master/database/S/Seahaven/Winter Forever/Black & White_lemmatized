" I say , " I can deliver to you a simple answer for it be far too complex for my complex to conceive ' Cause I just let you go , to let you go I run away , find drug just I do n't think you deserve what I be N'more importantly now , what I have become " so now you say , you say , you say " do n't you know that I be exactly what you want ? and still be what you want , and what you need but you seem to have forget , the promise you promise where you do not forget about me " you chase the time apart with alcohol and a fresh vibrant flame though I do question the value within the hue while I be hold in the arm of a friend , nearly drink myself to death I spill of how it have always be about you then that morning we make the sweet love I walk you outside to watch the sun as it rise to resemble you and @card@ day later , the moon shine upon your lie so now I say , I say , I say " do n't you know that I be exactly what you want ? and still be what you want , and what you need but you seem to have forget , the promise you promise where you do not forget about me " Hurry , hurry , hurry like I Scurry , scurry , scurry away Hurry , hurry , hurry before I get carry away Hurry , hurry , hurry like I Scurry , scurry , scurry away Hurry , hurry , hurry like I get carry away well , do n't you know that I be exactly what you want ? and still be what you want , and what you need but you seem to have forget , the promise you promise where you do not forget about me ___________________ name Black & White Artist Seahaven album Winter forever
