sometimes thing get in the way , my thought I can convey it be all point straight at you we hate love everyday our life , twirl in every way , I give it all back to you I ca n't help this go down I ca n't take this , all my life be reckless all our lie be dangerous , but we fake our way through that be what we do , we do sometimes , thing do n't go away in turn , you just run away it be all come back for you , betray , life be in decay your thought you can obey right now , whatcha gonna do ? I ca n't help this go down I ca n't take this , all my life be reckless all our lie be dangerous , but we fake our way through that be what we do , we do , we do , we do we do , we do , we do we do , we do , we do I hear the calling of the helpless stranger he be all alone and no one get his anger I feel this pain everytime I be here with you , with you all the heartache and the fuck up insult I find you beg on your knee , I figure this be how it be suppose to be with you , with you I ca n't wait for your lie to be break down I give you hell I ca n't take this , all my life be reckless all our lie be dangerous , but we fake our way through that be what we do I ca n't take this , all my life be reckless all our lie be dangerous , but we fake our way through that be what we do ________________ name what we do Artist Korn album the paradigm shift
