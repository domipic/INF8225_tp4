the madness creep up on me , the pressure 's building I foresee , alienation be lurk spawn lunacy . slowly escape this wreckage in make so do n't look back for me . sometimes we take it all . nothing stand in our way . we have to fight and crawl to die another day . die another day . die another day . misery often mislead . it create thing we can see . excessive thought be bind distort reality . slowly escape this carnage in make so do n't look back for me . sometimes we take it all . nothing stand in our way . we have to fight and crawl to die another day . die another day . die another day . hello , be you there ? how come wo n't you listen ? I really do n't care . I really do n't care . slowly escape this wreckage in make nothing will be the same . so do n't look back for me . sometimes we take it all . nothing stand in our way . we have to fight and crawl to die another day . sometimes we take it all . nothing stand in our way . we have to fight and crawl to die another day . _____________________ name die another Day Artist Korn album the paradigm shift
