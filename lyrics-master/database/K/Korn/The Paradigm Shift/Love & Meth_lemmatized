feeling you see be so hard to believe all the chaos I have in my heart Devils I make and the love can relate all the solace inside tear me up take me away , set me on fire there be no other way give me a reason ' cause I get nothing to gain so what be we do now ? feel complacent , I can be contain , I be so lose and lonely now Weaving deceit be so easy for me ' cause the loathing I have have from the start evil disease all the hatred it breathe as I be down on my knee tear apart take me away , set me on fire there be no other way give me a reason ' cause I get nothing to gain so what be we do now ? feel complacent , I can be contain , I be so lose and lonely now where do I run ? where do I hide ? give me a reason to my end my life where do I run ? where do I hide ? give me a reason to get out alive give me a reason ' cause I get nothing to gain so what be we do now ? feel complacent , I can be contain , I be so lose and lonely now give me a reason ' cause I get nothing to gain so what be I do now ? ( what be I do now ? ) feel complacent , I can be contain , I be so lose and lonely now _________________ name Love & Meth Artist Korn album the paradigm shift
