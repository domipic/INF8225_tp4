be you ready ? this place inside my mind a place I will like to hide you do n't know the chance what if I should die ? a place inside my brain another kind of pain you do n't know the chance I be so blind Blind Blind another mean I will find to escape the pain inside you do n't know the chance what if I should die ? a place inside my brain another kind of pain you do n't know the chance I be so blind blind blind deeper and deeper and deeper as I dream to live a life that seem to be a lose reality that I can never find a way to reach my inner self-esteem be low how deep can I go in the ground that I lie if I do n't find a way to see through the gray that cloud my mind this time I look to see what be between the line I can see , I can see I be goin ' blind I can see , I can see I be goin ' blind I can see , I can see I be goin ' blind I can see , I can see I be goin ' blind I can see , I can see I be goin ' blind I can see , I can see I be goin ' blind I can see , I can see I be goin ' blind I can see , I can see I be goin ' blind I can see , I can see I be goin ' blind I can see , I can see I be goin ' blind I can see , I can see I be goin ' blind I can see , I can see I be goin ' blind I be blind I be blind I be blind I be blind ___________ name Blind Artist Korn album Greatest hit , Volume @card@
