endless summer day that I spend with you under the light and shades eon old and new Watchin ' the sun go down in the deep blue Far in the distance sound , only wave come through so tell it on the street , tell it on the radio we be endless like the sea , a never-end flow in the deep blue in the deep blue Endless summer day that I spend with you into the salty haze of our wild youth Watchin ' the sun go down in the deep blue Far in the distance sound , only wave come through so tell it on the street , tell it on the radio we be endless like the sea , a never-end flow in the deep blue in the deep blue swimming in the deep swimming in the deep we be in the deep blue so tell it on the street , tell it on the radio we be endless like the sea , a never-end flow an endless an endless so tell it on the street , tell it on the radio tell it on the radio we be in the deep blue ______________________ name the deep Blue Artist Kristine album Kristine
