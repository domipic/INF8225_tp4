strand in the spooky town stoplight be sway and the phone line be down the floor be crackle cold she take my heart , I think she take my soul with the moon I run far from the carnage of the fiery sun drive by the strangle of vein show no mercy , I will do it again open up your eye you keep on cry , baby , I will bleed you dry the sky , they blink at me I see a storm bubble up from the sea now it be come closer now it be come close You shimmy shake my bone leave me strand , all in love on my own do you think of me ? where be I now , baby , where do I sleep ? feel so good , but I be old two thousand year of chasing , take its toll now it be come closer now it be come closer now it be come closer now it be come closer ____________ name closer Artist Kings of Leon album only by the night
