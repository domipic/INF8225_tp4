take it I surrender the attack Nevermind the killing daze and numb , strip to the core our moment be steal Time have win wounded soul our moment be steal Time have win beyond memory face I see Mean nothing to me only shadow in my dream beyond memory why be it me ? and no one can see ? only shadow in my dream Fake it I surrender to the fight I can see the darkness in your eye down to the bone your victim be choose Time have win all along your victim be choose Time have win beyond memory face I see Mean nothing to me only shadow in my dream beyond memory why be it me ? and no one can see ? only shadow in my dream paint me , with your colour and your love Nevermind the killing beyond memory face I see Mean nothing to me only shadow in my dream beyond memory why be it me ? and no one can see ? only shadow in my dream only shadow in my dream ... only shadow in my dream ... only shadow in my dream ___________________ name beyond Memory Artist Nina album sleepwalking write by N .
