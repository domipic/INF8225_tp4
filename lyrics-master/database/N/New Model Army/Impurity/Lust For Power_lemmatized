across the flatland we come out of nowhere special like a peasant revolution - makeshift weapon in our hand we crash the gate so hard we have never hear that kind of sound before and brace ourselves for victory and the spoil of the land defence melt away before our frozen blank surprise from the palace now we stare into a million wait eye Ch : I have get my trophy on the wall , the head I have hunt down the hall and I guard my winning well , carry them with me when I fall now the daylight hour pass like the people I have lose in the triumph of the hour , in the bloody cause - lust for power like a vision she dance through the shaft of light everything I have ever dream about focus true and bright and fortune open up the ground , blacken out the sky I kiss her once , I kiss her twice but I could n't remember why when I be young they teach me well to always play to win but they never say what happen when you have win the bloody game Ch : I have get my trophy on the wall . . . and all desire be satisfy but still the hunt go on it be funny how this feeling stay with all the reason go we have see them fat and bloated those who once could hold a flame I have run for home and word go by but nothing seem the same I can watch the world in secrecy from one side of this glass from the other my reflection and I do n't know which be bad the street be line with glitter store and a million fat calf I can catch myself sometimes these day and all I do be laugh , laugh Ch : I have get my trophy on the wall . . . ____________________ name Lust for Power Artist New Model Army album impurity
