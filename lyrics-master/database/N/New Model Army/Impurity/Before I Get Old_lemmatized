I be go to kiss the girl , make them cry live too fast , still not die - before I get old I be go to see you raise above this place watch the moment shine upon your face before I get old I will watch the sun set over every sea from every city wall , every mountain peak before I get old the Northern Lights and the Southern Cross the harvest and the mile of dust and the blow wind across the world so wrap this coat around yourself and leave what be do behind there be so much leave for us to do and yet there be so little time I be go to pull the fence to the ground watch the twisted tower come crumble down and start again I want to be a hero and a villain and a father and a son take care of my body and abuse it still until everything go numb so let be make this dance and never fear that there be any real reason why we be all here live real fast , still not die before I get old ______________________ name before I get Old Artist New Model Army album impurity
