I feel a shiver in the heat-haze and the wait time be over strange tongue on the airwaves as the voice call from distant land I see which be the win side but still I join the other and I be in love with every strange unfold day as the storm begin to break cover so let the whirlwind blow - through the ice , the melting snow - across the freezing sky and the tiny light below and so we shutter up the doorway as the ripple move towards us for a moment stop breathe - she wake and stir beneath our foot the order try to stand their ground , while every battlefront be shift they still believe that they can hold the rein but then they have get no sense of history so let the whirlwind blow - through the ice , the melting snow - across the freezing sky and the tiny light below - the water seething , bubble out of control - come on take my hand and we will dive a television blare in an empty room the poison water glisten Goliath stagger round in a punch-drunk daze do n't understand what hit him I see which be the win side but still I join the other and I be in love with every strange unfold day as the storm begin to break cover let the whirlwind blow - through the ice , the melting snow - across the freezing sky and the tiny light below - the water seething , out of control - we watch the ocean rise and the government start to fall - across the freezing sky until the light go out below _______________ name whirlwind Artist New Model Army album impurity
