you walk the thin of the ice , so easy to hurt we drive through the dark in the pour rain and barely say a word so dress your wound as good you can and close your tired eye try to climb away from here towards the empty sky and I will meet you there , high above it all in the kiss of air , the lover 's breath vision rise from each little death as Moses stand and turn his gaze away from the feud tribe Walks towards the mountain and through the rock he climb God , he order Moses , " Bring the people to my will " " leave me be , " cry Moses , keep on walk up the hill and I will meet you there , high above it all in the kiss of air , the lover 's breath vision rise from each little death and should the devil come and should he say " all of this will I give to you , if you just bow down and worship me " I be on my knee " the white twisted cloud and the endless shade of blue in the ocean make the hum of the spacecraft system , the radio chatter , even your own breathing disappear . there be no cold or wind or smell to tell you that you be connect to Earth . you have an almost dispassionate platform - remote , Olympian and yet so move that you can hardly believe how emotionally attach you be to those rough pattern shift steadily below .
