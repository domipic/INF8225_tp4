they provide their nectar and then I be release . I be a grain of sand , underneath the floor and so far out of reach , but I be safe from harm . against this shelter they be always hammer . against these ear they be always deafen . I too know an angry language . our pain be always , accurate and strive to evade , its only design . it want to strike you down , to fall into its arm again . blood be thick than water , but which one do you drink ? what I know be divide and break down , by the ignorance of other . speak from their lip , but with the lung of another . sound great , but taste like blood . these rumor session be assemble by us all ... by us all . they be the earth and we be the breath of life . your pain be always , accurate and strive to evade , its only design . I want to strike you down , to fall into my arm again . blood be thick than water , but which one do you drink ? do you drink ? put down that retribution . I do n't need your absolution . _________________________________________ name a Media Friendly turn for the bad Artist Norma Jean album meridional
