we will be legend we be smashed man , still move we have try everything in the book no stranger to failure , death with a steady heartbeat scratch into any surface it want Joy and beauty reject so many time a world of hurt , a heart of false hope and while we think that we be learn how to live we have be learn how to die I should have know , we will be legend our hope and dream , our bad nightmare our bad nightmare have now come true tonight when this deep sleep fall on man drive by an instinct more powerful than life itself from horror to hope , from hope and devastation and while we think that we be learn how to live we have be learn how to die I should have know , we will be legend overfeed and unconcerned it come with tooth and claw oh , hate form of emotion you have become so obvious my friend , the fatal habit of be myself Ok , there be hope , step down with all your friend _____________________________ name song sound much sad Artist Norma Jean album redeemer
